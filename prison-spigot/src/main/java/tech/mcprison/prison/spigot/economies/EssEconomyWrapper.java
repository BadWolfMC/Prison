/**
 * <p>A non-static wrapper of Essentials' annoyingly static {@link net.ess3.api.Economy} API.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p><b>Warning:</b>  There is a known issue with essentials where internally
 *                    they are generating a NPE when trying it initially look up
 *                    a player when their names do not match, or their UUIDs have
 *                    been changed due to changing to an offline server.  Basically
 *                    it's an issue that has been troubling essentials for a while
 *                    now (a few years), so they are internally generating a 
 *                    stack trace when they detect a certain condition.  This 
 *                    stack trace is not able to be caught and suppressed by Prison, 
 *                    so as such, it may appear frequently within the servers
 *                    console.  The bottom line is that essentials still works
 *                    even through they are generating this stack trace (they want
 *                    to log a certain kind of condition) and prison still works.
 *                    It just produces a ton of confusing garbage.  It is unknown
 *                    when they will fix their code and remove it.
