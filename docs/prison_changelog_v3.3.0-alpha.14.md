# 3.3.0-alpha.14 2023-01-23



The following are significant changes that are included in the alpha.14 release since the alpha.13 release was posted.

* Support for RevEnchants


* Added more flexibility in supporting Prison Event Listener priorities for block break events so prison is better suited to support more enchantment plugins under more conditions. Added ACCESS, ACCESSBLOCKBREAKS, and ACCESSMONITOR to provide far more flexibility when prison is NOT managing the block breakage.


* General improvements in how Auto Features manages the event listeners for all of the block break events. Includes some bug fixes and performance improvements too.


* Preparing to support ItemsAdder... will be available in next alpha release.*


* Prison Placeholders: Added a few more, fixed a few bugs, and improved documentation so its easier to understand how to use them. Added more features to the command `/prison placeholders stats`.  The stats command can actually be used to troubleshoot issues with third-party plugins trying to use prison placeholders.


* Top-n reports and placeholders: bug fixes and added a few more features.


* Mine commands: refactor and improvements to some of the general mine commands.


* Prison Placeholders: general bug fixes and performance improvements with the placeholder cache.


* Prison's bstats: Expanded the reports that are being included.


* Prison Command Handler: ability to lockout players from commands and tab-completes based upon perms.


* Mines GUI Bug fixes: fixed a few issues.


* Issue with vault not working with essentials: Not able to access player's balances through vault and provided alternative paths to resolve this issue.


* Prison support new feature: tracking command usage along with average run times: `/prison support cmdStats`. 


* Improved some of the `/prison support submit` features to include more of the newer data that prison is using.


* Updates to a number of libraries that prison uses: 
placeholderApi: v2.10.9 to v2.11.2
XSeries: v9.0.0 to v9.2.0
item-nbt-api: v2.10.0 to v2.11.1


* Removal of support for MVDW placeholders since it's not able to support some of prison's advanced features, plus it's 100% redundant since PlaceholderAPI works in conjunction with it. No loss of service since PAPI is a better solution and works with MVDW.


* Added a Prison Backup feature that can make a backup of all the settings within prison's plugin directory (small zip file backups).  It is setup to make a backup whenever it detects a change in the prison versions.  In the future, it could be automated to make snapshots of all settings and player status so there can be abilities to "rollback" to a prior instance.


* Added new translations: Finnish, Chinese, 


* Enhanced the player GUIs for mines and ranks to use NBT to control the options to simplify how the options work. Eliminated a lot of old code and added more flexibility.


* Enable the sellall command to be ran from the console or from a prison command.


* Enhanced the debug logging detail related to the auto features. Provides better logging for troubleshooting.


* Using a static global setting for decimal formatting to better control how numeric formatting works with various language settings.


* Able to now control suffocation in the mines, so you can now allow players to die if they logged out within a mine and they log back buried in rock.


* Able to control mine reset teleportation controls.


* Added direct support for translating placeholders through the Prison API so its easier to use externally through another plugin.


* Now able to set a prestige rank tag to use for players that do not have a prestige rank. This allows for better customization for chat prefixes.


* Fixed a bug when trying to move a mine from one world to another world.  There was a conflict with an internal value not being cleared/reset.


* Fixed a Prison Mine Bomb bug that was making them incompatible with bukkit 1.8.8.


* Fixed a bug with how a vector's length was being calculated. Not sure how frequently this would have been used.


* Refactoring Prison Backpacks. Getting ready to hook them up to a new internal backpack cache to improve performance.  Not yet completed.


* Fixed bug with /rankupmax and rewrote prestiges to better align it with the ranks module instead of relying upon the GUI code to manage it.


* Enhanced many mine and rank commands to apply changes to all ranks or all mines with one command to make it easier to customize prison.


* New feature setting (optional): Forced rankup as soon as the player earns enough money through sellall.


* New feature setting (optional): Forced sellall before performing a prestige.


* New feature setting (optional): Prevent access to prior mines when ranking up. This foces the player to only have access to mines that are linked to the current rank.  This feature allows the use of Mine and TP access by rank instead of having to setup complex settings with perms through a permission plugin.




**Prison v3.3.0-alpha.14 2023-01-23**


* **Misc NBT stuff... Did not work out as planned so it has been commented out for now.**


* **Start to setup support for ItemsAdder but it's not hooked up yet so it does not do anything.**
Most of the parts are hooked up, but it just needs to support the ItemsAdder's event that lets other plugins know when everything is fully loaded and it's ready.


* **Prison placeholders: Added details to help understand how to use some of the more confusing placeholders.**
Fixed the grouping of two `prison_top_mine_block_line_` placeholders.


* **AutoFeatures Event Listeners: Add new feature where if a player tries to mine in a mine they don't have access to, that it will teleport them to a mine that is linked to their current rank.**


* **AutoFeatures Event Listeners: Minor tweaks to the ACCESS priority. Testing has been going well.**


* **AutoFeatures Event Listeners: Improved the reporting and refactored to reduce duplicate code.**


* **AutoFeatures event listeners: ACCESS priority: Hooked up ACCESS processing and cleaned up the code a little more.**


* **AutoFeatures event listeners: More work on getting ACCESS setup, focused on support for `/prison support listeners blockBreak` and to generate multiple listeners for the compounded priorities such as ACCESSBLOCKBREAKS and ACCESSMONITOR.**
Tested successfully the creation of multiple listeners.  Have not yet hooked up the support for ACCESS.


* **AutoManager event listeners: refactored to prepare for the ACCESS priorities.**


* **AutoFeatures Event Listeners: More refactoring to simplify how the debugInfo is passed around.**


* **AutoFeatures refactoring: changes the setup of how the events deals with finding the mine the player is in.**
The code was looking up the mine twice, now it only searches for the mine once and reused it more efficiently. 
This simplifies how some of the code works and allows for more simplification too.


* **Fix a few things with the RevEnchants listeners.**
They were not hooked up for the `/prison support listeners blockevents` and they were not being registered to actually enable.


**v3.3.0-alpha.13h3 2023-01-18**


* **Enhanced the command `/prison support listeners help` to format the columns for name and priority so they all align.**


* **Comment on an issue within EssenialsX that is purposefully generating stack traces within the console, and there is nothing prison can do about it.**
Plus, everything is working fine.
https://github.com/EssentialsX/Essentials/issues/3956


* **Update docs to see if it supports GFM tables**


* **AutoFeatures Event Listeners: refactored how a the event is processed so they share more of the same code base.  This helps to eliminate the chances for bugs to happen for a few listeners, and it also help to ensure that the behavior for all of the listeners are identical.**
If a event is marked as DISABLED, then the listener should never be loaded, but if it is, then it will quickly end the processing instead of allowing it to filter through all of the code.


* **AutoFeatures: Prepare for a few new priorities for the event listeners.**


* **AutoFeatures: Bug fix.  Found that all events that were canceled were automatically being ignored, which was causing the MONITOR priority to be bypassed since MONITOR should be able to process what it needs to even on a canceled event.**


* **AutoFeatures: Have the external events register when the AutoManager is being setup.  This eliminates the need to have it always check for registration on each event call.**


* **There was a report that TopN was failing with a NPE when Ranks was disabled.  This was related to the PlayerManager not being initialized.**
Added code to ensure that TopN is shutdown, and does not try to run, if the Ranks Module, or PlayerManager is not loaded.
It looks like it could have been called through the bStats reporting... which is now fixed.


* **AutoFeatures refactoring: Cleaned up a lot of the code related to blockCounts, blockEvents, and zero-block resets (reset thresholds) and code related to the "monitor" priorities to better ensure they are handled correctly and better documented.**
This may fix a few obscure bugs, but not 100% sure if they have been encountered.
This also unbundles some of the functions so they are not hidden so deeply... this makes the code much easier to read and to know what's happening.


* **Setup a function to check if a BlockBreakPriority is considered a monitor level priority, which is useful when adding more non-block breaking priorities.**


* **Expand the comments to better explain the roles of MONITOR and BLOCKEVENTS priorities.**


* **Fix a problem with MONITOR and BLOCKEVENTS priorities where they were failing to process the event if the block was broke, of which should be permitted.**


* **Added RevEnchant's events to the special condition of not being able to identify the original block that was broken.**


* **Doc updates.  Update info on Essentials Economy bypassing Vault and adding RevEnchants to the list of supported enchantment plugins have been added.**


* **Added support for RevEnchants ExplosiveEvent and JackHammerEvent.**


* **Adjustments to improve readability of the '/mines info' command.**


* **Simplify a few mine related commands to use the permission mines.set.**


* **Change command from '/mines set skipReset` to `/mines set resetSkip` to try to better align similar commands.**
Improved the help for the command too.  Added support for '*all*' mines too.


**v3.3.0-alpha.13h2 2023-01-11**


* **Prison placeholder bug fix: the placeholder cache was causing placeholders to be rejected and locked out under certain conditions which were being triggered by new players joining the server for the first time.**
The cache was fixed by better identifying what constitutes a failed placeholder identifier.  Enhanced the stats report to include fails too, which can be useful in finding internal errors with specific placeholders.


**v3.3.0-alpha.13h 2023-01-07**


* **Update bstats... will have to update the reports on the bstats page too.***


* **Updated the language files to replace a bad text message which was missing.**


* **Placeholders bug fix: prison_top_rank_balance_* placeholders were fixed both in enabling processing for these placeholders, and also enabling the sequence.**


* **Placeholder Cache: Provide a way to clear the cache of all entries or just the invalid entries.**
This helps to debug potential issues since it does not require restarting the server to force a reassignment of mapped placeholderKeys.


* **Bug fix: Fixed an issue with the top-n player's balance not being hooked up to the return value of the function that was retrieving it.**


* **Issue with vault not working: Fixed a problem where prison was not able to communicate with an older version of vault** (spigot 1.12.2) while prison test servers could not duplicate the issue.
The allows an admin to configure their server to disable the use of vault when using the essentialsEconomy, SaneEconomy, or GemsEconomy.  This will not work for any other economy.
Since vault was the problem, bypassing vault allows prison to communicate directly with the selected economies, which fixes the problem.


* **Prison Command Handler: Tab Completer:** Lockout players from the commands that have been excluded from players based upon perms.  Such commands are now excluded from the suggested commands when the player is using the tab-complete.


* **Mines GUI bug fixes:**
Fixes an issue with the command `/mines tp` which was setup to test an alias on a test server, but was not changed back to the correct command.
Fixes the proper display of the linked rank to the mine.  It was showing the "object" which was dumping more than just the rank tag to the GUI's lore.  It now shows just the rank tag.


* **Added the tracking of command run times to the `/prison support cmdStats`.**


* **Update various libraries used in the gradle build:**
placeholderApi: v2.10.9 to v2.11.2
XSeries: v9.0.0 to v9.2.0
item-nbt-api: v2.10.0 to v2.11.1
removal of mvdw from the gradle build since it was removed from prison a few months ago


* **Added a prison backup save command (renamed the original prison backup) and added a prison backup logs command that shows all entries in the backup log file.**
The contents of the backup log file has been added to the /prison support submit version command too.


* **Fixed the prison command stats to show the correct number of commands listed.**


* **Fix the use of `{br}` when using `/prison support submit version` so that it is now treated as `\n`.
Added to the `/prison support submit version` all listeners and the command stats too.**


* **Added a new command `/prison support cmdStats` which shows some basic stats on command usage.**8


* **v3.3.0-alpha.13g 2022-12-28**


* **Added Finnish translations to prison!**
Thearex12 contributed a number of Finnish translations for prison in the following 
modules: core (partial), mines, and sellall.  More updates are in progress.
If anyone else would like to contribute another translation, please ping me, 
RoyalBlueRanger, on our discord server.  It can be a complete translation, or 
a partial.  Thanks!


* **There is a growing problem with the use of % symbols being processed multiple times with the Java String.format() which results in format escape error.**
First, the use of Output is new setup to handle it's own custom version of String.formatIO that will take any remaining percent symbol and encode it so it does not cause errors anymore, then right before passing it to bukkit, it will convert it back.  This allows it to pass through as many String.format() functions as needed without resulting in to any problems.
The other fix, which is probably more significant, is that the Output functions no longer tries to run all messages through String.format() if there are no parameters to apply.  This was causing the most issues.
To properly ensure the more complex message handling works correctly, the use of Output.stringFormat(() should be use to enable to the encoding of the percent symbols.


* **Fixed a typo in the config.yml that covered what the default values were for the includeCmdAltPerms and includeCmdPerms settings.**


* **Player GUI for mines and ranks was changed to include within the NBT codes, and enabled the mines TP command to be set in the NBT command tag.** 
This will allow the NBT handler within the SpigotGUIMenuTools.processGUIPage(), of which it would just run the supplied command.  This bypasses the need of using special code to extract the mine name or rank name to reconstruct a command.  In short, this allows the TP On Click action to be self contained without the need for special handlers.
This is a fix for the fully customizable ranks and mines GUI menus for the players, where the mine name on lore line 1 was eliminated, and hence the old way was unable to identify what mine should initiate the tp event.  But having the plain mine name on line one resulted in multiple redundancies of the mine's name, along with the mine's tag and the item's header.


* **New Feature: command lockout:** Updated to add debugging information to identify why a command is rejected for a player through logging in the console when prison is in debug mode.


* **New Feature: command lockout:** expanded to get this to work for commands, help listings, and aliases. There is now a setting where if enabled, it will expand the lockout from a command to all aliases of that command.  Also on each command, it will will allow enabling (enabled by default) if either the command parms or parmAlts are used to exclude a player from a command.


* **New feature: command lockout for users based upon perms set in the config.yml.**
This is the first stage of getting this setup, where it locks out the running of a command.
Need to lockout the help next, which is what generates the command lists.


* **Enhancements to the player's gui for ranks and mines so it's less hard coded and now with more options.**
Parts of the GuiConfig.yml file will need to be removed so the new content can be generated the next time the gui configs are loaded.


* **Eliminate the stack trace because it makes it appear as if there is a non-handled error in prison.  The error is already being shown in more detail.**


* **Sellall sell can now be ran from a command or the console by specifying the player's name.**
The player must be online for this work.  An offline player cannot have their inventory modified or sold.


* **Chinese Translation Added!**
Thanks to M1032 on github #240, prison now has full Simplified Chinese translations!  To use this translation, set the language code to zh-CH.


* **cleaned up the enchantment names**


* **Enabled more detailed logging when block break events are being ignored by the auto features.**
Mostly related to either the player not holding a pickaxe, or the block has already been broke, or exploded.
Now also showing information on what the player is holding, which will help identify why a block break event is behaving the way it is.


* **Set version to v3.3.0-alpha.13f - 2022-12-12**


* **Setup a static version of DecimalFormat which is needed to be used within all static functions.**  If the DecimalFormatSymbols variable is set by a static function, then it will be replaced at the first chance by a non-static call.  The static usage, if not set first by the non--static calls, cannot access the config.yml settings.  This really is not a problem, since it would only be through unit tests when the gradle build is being processed that will need the alternative settings.


* **Setup the control over number formatting by using Prison as the single source of constructing a DecimalFormat object.**
This is done through manually setting the DecimalFormatSymbols to use en_US.  It has also been enabled in config.yml to allow setting the language code that is used, to any value the admin may wish to use.  It's a problem when en_US is not used, but someone may have a specific reason not to use en_US.  Mostly the primary trouble is related to Minecraft not being able to properly display NBSP unicode characters.


* **Mine suffocation can now be enabled so if you turn off teleportation, then the players can now die.**


* **Mine reset teleportation can now be controlled within the config.yml file.**

* **Prison API: Add support for direct prison placeholder support.**
Two new functions: one translates only one prison placeholder.  The other function takes full text message and will translate multiple prison placeholders if they are wrapped in placeholder escape characters.


* **AutoFeatures: add failure reason when prison is unable to successfully process a block break event due to zero drops.**


**3.3.0-alpha.13e 2022-11-16**


* **New feature: Prestiges placeholder name and tag now can be assigned to a non-blank space for players that do not have a prestige rank.**
This applies to the base placeholders: prison_rank, prison_rank_laddername, prison_rank_tag, and prison_rank_tag_laddername.


* **Add the ability to format the percentage of prison_rankup_cost_percent with the NFormat placeholder attribute.**


***Fix issue with world not being removed, or replaced when the mine is converted to a virtual mine, or when the mine is moved to another world.**
The problem would be the config settings for the mine would save correctly, but upon the server restart, it would revert to the old world. The problem was with the non-saved world field not being reset correctly.  This fixes the issue correctly so it's should work properly under all situations.


**3.3.0-alpha.13d 2022-11-02**
NOTE: Changes to PrisonBlock structures have been stashed and are not included in this alpha.13d release.


* **Added some mine info to the `/prison version command.***


* **Mine Bombs bug fix: Was using a function that was incompatible with bukkit 1.8.8 and this fixes that issue.**
Using a prison compatibility function to provide the compatibility.
Added more information on why mine bombs are not working when prison is in debug mode.


**3.3.0-alpha.13c 2022-10-17**
NOTE: Changes to PrisonBlock structures have been stashed and are not included in this alpha.13c release.


* **Small updates to help prepare for the internal change to how PrisonBlocks are structured.**


* **Bug: Found a major bug in calculating a vector's length since x should have been squared, but instead it was multiplied by y.**
The use of vectors is limited within Prison, but when used, this could cause issues.


* **If inspection of other plugin's jars fail, then just ignore this issue and continue on processing.**


* **New prison backpacks: More work on getting them setup for testing the BackpackCache.**
Adding hooks to load from the old prison backpacks.


* **Fixed an issue with MINEPLAYER placeholders which resulted in false fast-fails when players would leave a mine.**
Once a placeholder would fail, even if it was working before, it would be impossible to reenable the placeholder value from being evaluated in the future due to the nature and purpose of the fast-fail.
The MINEPLAYER placeholders actually has three states: invalid placeholder (any invalid placeholder string), valid with mine object, and valid without mine object.  So the valid without mine object was getting translated as invalid placeholder.
The fix was to allow even valid without mines to be processed by their respective block of code, but within each block of code had to add if-not-null checks to prevent other null pointer failures.
**Note:** This issue may have been related to other recent placeholder issues that have not been able to be resolved.


* **For some of the gui commands, like `/gui ranks`, `/gui prestiges`, and `/gui mines` the button now closes the gui instead of trying to run the command `/gui`.**


* **Add config settings to control the gui rankup buttons.**


* **Update many gui messages to use the newer message handler so the old deprecated functions can be removed eventually.**
There are still many more to do, but this covers a good start.


* **Move the mine bombs cooldown message to the spigot language files.**


* **Removed support for MVdWPlaceholder plugin.**
It generates way too many entries in the log, and there is zero support for it from the providers.
It's also unneeded since PlaceholderAPI works perfectly fine with it, so it's 100% pointless.


* **More refactoring of the old backpacks to get rid of bad code to make it easier to integrate in to a newer backpack framework.**
No behavioral changes should have occurred with this commit, and the prior commit too.


* **Refactor Prison's old backpacks to reduce duplicate code to prepare for use of the BackpackCache.**


* **Changed the command `/mines set notification` to work with both disable and disabled.**


* **Initial setup of BackpackCache code.  Not test.  Not hooked up yet to anything.  But the cache should be functional.**


* **v3.3.0-alpha.13b 2022-09-07**


* **Prestige: Rewrote the prestige commands to move them from the generic spigot module to the ranks module where it should belong with the other rank related commands.**
All rank and prestige related logic was removed from the GUI.  The new /prestige command was created in the ranks module. It now performs a precheck to ensure the player is able to prestige, and it now reflects the correct configurations as far as showing the player if their default ranks and monies will be reset.  Confirmations were also fixed, where they were not working with the prior chat confirmation.  The new gui uses a simplified process where it is given the default settings for the displayed lore.  The only behavior the gui now has, is that if the player clicks on confirm, then it will rerun the prestige command with "confirm" added so the confirmation is bypassed.
This is working far better now.


* **Fixes issues with /rankupmax.**
Confirmation on prestiging does not work.


* **Modified a number of mines commands to add a global *all* feature to allow easier management of applying commands to more than one name at a time.**


* **Fix an issue with leading spaces in prison commands, especially right after using semi-colons to chain multiple commands.**


* **v3.3.0-alpha.13a 2022-09-01**


* **Cleaned up the /rankupmax command to improve on the messaging so it's not as spammy.**
Improvements with the /rankupmax prestiges command too.


* **Redone how the command `/rankupmax` works.**
The command `/rankupmax` and `/rankupmax default` has not changed, but has been improved to supply the correct next rank using the newer getNextRank function to ensure consistency.
The command `/rankupmax prestiges` used to only provide the same behavior as `/prestige` and `/rankup prestiges`.  The new behavior is that `/rankupmax prestiges` will first perform `/rankupmax` then it will try `/rankup prestiges`. If completes successfully, then it will repeat both the rankupmax and prestiges, and etc.


* **Fixed an issue with the RankPlayer.getNextPlayerRank() which was not returning the first prestige rank if at end of default and no prestiges.**
Had to hook in to the LadderManager, routing through Platform, to get the presetiges ladder to pull the first prestige rank.
Adding this capability expands the functional usefulness of this function greatly.  Now if this function returns a null, then it means the player is at the last possible rank.


* **Add to the platform the ability to get a specific RankLadder.**


* **New feature: Auto Forced Rankup.  When using autosell, it will auto rankup the player when they have enough money.**
This includes both normal /rankup and /prestige.
This configuration setting is set within config.yml in prison-mines.forced-auto-rankups: true.


* **Enable access to prior mines, or prevent access to prior mines, based upon the player's rank.**
See `prison-mines.access-to-prior-mines` in config.yml


* **New feature for Prestige: Force a sellall before processing the prestige.**
This prevents the player from stashing a ton of high-value blocks in their inventory before prestiging.
This will not prevent the player from stashing blocks elsewhere.


**3.3.0-alpha.13 2022-08-25**

Highlights of some of the changes included in this alpha.13 release. Please see the change logs for all details.


* Added a new tool: `mines tp list` which will show a player all of the mines they have access to.  They can also click on a listed mine to generate the TP command.  This command can also be ran from the console to inspect what players have access to.
* Fixed a recently introduced bug where if the server starts up, but someone has no ranks, it was not able to properly assign them their first default rank. It was leading to circular references.
* Fixed an issue with color codes not being translated correctly with placeholderAPI.   
* Prison has a rank cost multiplier where ranks on different ladders can increase, or decrease, the cost of all ranks the player buys.  So when they prestige, it makes ranks A-Z cost more each time.  What's new is that now you can control which ladders these rank cost multipliers are applied to, such as not on prestiges, but only on default.
* Fixed calculations of the placeholder `prison_rank__player_cost_rankname`.  It was not fully working with every possible rank on every possible ladder.  Now it works correctly if trying to get the player's cost for even many prestige ranks out (it includes cals for all A-Z mines at multiple passes).
* Mine bombs: Changed to only allow mine bombs to be setoff withn mines the player has access to. Fixed an issue with color codes within the mine bomb's tags.
* Fixes issues with NBT, color codes with prison broadcast commands.
* Rewrote topN for better performance: `/topn`. Older players are archived within topN and can be queried: `/topn archive`. 
* Update ladder details on a few commands.
* Update XSeries from v8.8.0 to v9.0.0 so prison now supports 1.19.x blocks.
* Bug fixes with first join events.  Bug fix with a few guis.
* CMI update: If CMI is detected at startup, and delayed startup is not enabled, prison will go in a simple delayed startup mode to allow CMI a chance to enable it's economy through vault.  This reduces the learning curve with CMI users.
* New feature: Prison will now make an auto backup of all files in it's directory when it detects a change in version.  Can manually backup too. The backup stores temp files then removes them from the server, this helps keep the server clean.
* Update bstats: Gained control of the account and started to add useful custom reports to help zero in on what we need to help support.
* More work on block converts. Will be added in the next alpha releases.
* Bug fixes: mines gui fixes for virtual mines.  Sellall bug fixes. Placeholders fixes.




* **Minor addition to bstats.**


* **Player Mine GUI had the wrong calculation for volume which also threw off blocks remaining and percent remaining.**
The calculation for volume was using the surface area and not the total number of blocks.


**v3.3.0-alpha.12L 2022-08-25**


* **Updates to the bstats....**


* **New placeholders: `prison_rank__linked_mine_tag_rankname` and alias `prison_r_lmt_rankname`.**
Similar to `prison_rank__linked_mine_rankname` but uses the mine's tag instead of the mine's name.


* **Mine TP list: use mine tags and clickable mines to teleport to them.**


* **Mines TP list.  Added a new options to mines tp command to list all mines that the player actually has access to.**
Not finished with it... will add clickable links to them when in game.


* **There was an unused updated tool in prison.  It's against my policy to auto update this plugin, which would need to be consented to anyway, but I feel that admins need to be in full control of updates and know what is included in the updates. There was identified a potential exploit called zip-slip-vulnerability that could hijack a server if malicious zip is extracted.  Prison never used this tool, so it's been fully disabled with no intention of reenabling.  It may be deleted in the near future.**


* **TopN bug fix: If a player was in an archived state, they were not being moved to active when they would login.**


* **If the player is holding the mine bomb in their off hand, then remove the inventory from their off hand.**


* **v3.3.0-alpha.12k**


* **Fixed an issue when starting the server an no ranks exist.  Also fixes an issue when starting the server an a player has no rank.**
Was using a mix of really old code, and the latest code, which caused a conflict since neither was doing what it was really supposed to.


* **Added the custom bstats report for Prison Vault Plugins.**
This reports all plugins that have been integrated through Vault.  This report does not impact any other plugins report.  This is segmented by integration type.


* **Fixed bug when server starts up when no player ranks exist.**
It will now bypass the player validation until ranks have been configured.


* **v3.3.0-alpha.12j 2022-08-21**


* **Update bstats to remove old custom reports that are not wanted/needed anymore.**
Added 6 new placeholder reports that classifies placeholders ini various categories related to how they are used within prison.  Any placeholder that appears in these lists, will not be included in the generic 4-category placeholder lists.
Added a few more simple pie charts to cover a lot of the details on ranks, ladders, and players.  Simple is better so you can just glance at all of them, without having to drill down on each one.
 

* **v3.3.0-alpha.12i 2022-09-19**


* **TopN players - fixed an issue where topN was being processed before the offline players were validated and fixed.**
There was an issue with processing an invalid player that did not have a default rank.


* **v3.3.0-alpha.12h 2022-08-19**


* **Rankup costs: Minor clean up of existing code. Using the calculateTargetPlayerRank function within the RankPlayer object.**


* **PAPI Placeholders: Force color code translations on all resulting placeholders.**
There were a few issues where placeholder color codes were not being properly translated.  This was not consistent with everyone.  Not sure why it was working for most.
These changes are more in line with how chat handlers and MVdW placeholders works.


* **Ladder: apply rank cost multiplier to a ladder or not.**
This new feature enables you to disable all rank cost multipliers for a specific ladder.  Normally that rank cost multiplier applies to all ladders, but now you can suppress it.  It's for the whole ladder, and not on a per rank basis.


* **Fixed an issue with calculating the player's rank cost when they already on the presetiges ladder and calculating the higher prestige ranks.**
Appears as if this becomes an issue when at the last rank on the default ladder.


* **v3.3.0-alpha12g 2022-08-14**


* **Fxing of the calculations of the placeholder prison_rank__player_cost_rankname and related placeholders.**
The original implementation did not take in to consideration the prestige ranks in relation to the default rank.  
The improvements in this calculation now generates a list of all ranks between the current rank and the target rank.  So if a few prestige ranks out from the player's current prestige rank will result in calculating every rank in between including multiple passes through all default ranks.  So if there are 26 default ranks, and the player is at rank A with no prestiges, then to calculate rank P4 would include the following ranks:
b --> z + p1 + a --> z + p2 + a --> z + p3 + a --> z + p4.  
This results in a total of 107 ranks that must be collected, then the player's cost for each rank will have to be calculated.  Then all of these must be added together to get the player's cost on rank P4.
This calculation has to be performed for each rank in it's entirety
Warning: this calculation on high prestige ranks will be a performance issue. If this becomes a problem on any particular server, then the only recommendation that can be provided is not to use any of the prison_rank__player_cost placeholders.


* **TopN : a few more adjustments to fix a few issues with duplicates and also with using values from within the topN to include in the report to help minimize the need to recalculate everything especially with archived entries.**


* **Mine bombs: Fixed an issue with the mine bomb names not always working with color codes.**
Honestly the wrong function was being used so how it even worked I don't know. lol


* **New topN functionality: far better performance, with regular updates.**
TopN now is a singleton and is self contained.  When the singleton is instantiated, it then loads and setup the prisonTopN.json file on the first run.  30 seconds after the initial load, it then hits all players to load their balances in an async thread.  
The command /ranks topn, or just /topn has new parameter: "archived".  Any player who has not been online for more than 90 days will be marked as archived.  The archived option will show just the archived players.
Setup new parameters within config.yml to control the topn behavior with the async task.


* **v3.3.0-alpha.12f 2022-08-08 ** (forgot to commit when made this version)


* **Mine Bombs: Only allow bombs to be placed when within a mine that the player has access to.**
This will help prevent wasted bombs.


* **Fixed an issue with nbt items not having a value for toString().**


* **Encode color codes for the prison utils broadcast command.**


* **Added an "invalid player name" message to the rankup commands.**
Also added missing messages to the zh_TW.properties file. 


* **BlockEvents were changed to auto display the existing rows so it's easier for the end user to know which row to select.**
All they need to do is to enter the mine's name, then press enter to submit the command, and then the existing rows details will be shown.  Then the user can select the row and complete the command.
Updated docs on block events.


* **BlockEvents were changed to auto display the existing rows so it's easier for the end user to know which row to select.**
All they need to do is to enter the mine's name, then press enter to submit the command, and then the existing rows details will be shown.  Then the user can select the row and complete the command.


* **minor updates for disabled mine reset times. No functional changes were  made.**


* **Fixed a potential NPE with giving the players overflow blocks, but not sure what the exact cause was, but looked like there was an issue with mapping to a spigot item stack.**


 **CMI delayed startup: Added new feature to try to auto enable Prison's delayed startup if CMI is detected as an active plugin, and if the delayed startup is disabled within the config.yml.**
This is to help get more CMI users up and running without more effort, but yet still provide the ability to customize how it is triggered.
If CMI is active, there is NO WAY to disable a delayed startup check.*

* **Added the the option for playerName to the `/rankup` command so the command can be scripted and ran from the console.**


* **There was another issue with using `/gui` related to no ladders being loaded.**
This fixes that problem, and it appears like the issue was caused by plugman messing things up.  This does not "solve" the problem with ladders not being loaded, but prevents the NPE from happening.


* **There was an issue with `/prison reload gui` causing a NPE.**


* **Fixed the `/ranks topn` command (`/topn`) to sort the list of players before printing the list.**
The list was being set a server startup time, and if someone would rankup or prestige, it was not reflecting their new position.  The list is also now sorted after each rankup.  Sorting should be a low cost operation since the list used never is regenerated so the changes made during sorting is minimal at best.


* **Added the ability to control the prefix spaces on the unit names.**
NOTE: may need to enable the use of the `core_text__time_units_short` since the long units are not being used.  May need to create another placeholder for short/long.  It used to be short, so may need to use long with the new placeholder and convert the calcs to the short as the default.
This was requested by PassBL.


* **v3.3.0-alpha.12e**


* **Fixed issue rank null issues when showing ladder details.**


* **Prison backups: Fixed an issue with folders not existing when running the backups the first time.**


* **v3.3.0-alpha.12d 2022-07-25**


* **Added more information on ladder listing to show name, number of ranks, and rank cost multiplier.**


* **bStats update: Added a new bstats custom chart for auto features.**


* **Update some docs. Added docs for Prison Backups**
[Prison Backup Document](prison_docs_050_Prison_backups.md)


* **Upgrade XSeries from v8.8.0 to v9.0.0**


* **Fixed issue with prison version check triggering a backup upon startup.**
It was always bypassing the previous version check, so it was always creating another backup.


* **Update bstats by moving to its own class in its own package.**
Added 4 new custom charts to split the plugins in to 4 parts.


* **Fixed a few issues with the ranks gui where they were using the wrong message key (placeholder).**


* **Prison v3.3.0-alpha.12c**



* **Prison bstats: setup 4 new bstats charts for prison.  May change a few charts or add new ones in the near future.**
Got control over the prison bstats so can now add custom stats.


* **Prison backups: Created a Prison/backups/versions.log file which gets logs when a new prison version is detected on startup, which also performs a backup.**                                                                                                                                                                                      
All backups are also logged in the versions.log file too.


* **v3.3.0-alpha.12b**
- Added the fix for the placeholders. See next note.


* **Fixed an issue with placeholders not be properly evaluated; there were 3 sections and they were combined in to one so it would not bypass any.**


* **Possible bug fix with first join: it appears like it was inconsistant with running the rank commands.  Fixed by rewriting how the first join event is handled.**



* **Prison backups: Added new features where it is generating a stats file in the root of the zip file which contains all of the "prison support submit" items.**
This is just about ready, but lacking support for auto backups when prison versions change, or job submission to run auto backups at regular intervals.


* **Setup a prison backup command that will backup all files within the prison plugin folder.**
When finished, it will delete all temp files since they have been included in the backup.
The new command is `/prison support backup help`.


* **v3.3.0-alpha.12a**


* **Added a new set of intelligent placeholders: these show the tags for the default ladder and prestige ladder, for the "next" rank but are linked together.**
They only apply to the default ladder and the prestige ladders.  The tags are only shown if the player has that rank, or if that will become their next rank.  
These ONLY show the tags that will be appropriate when the next rank up.  So if the can still rankup on the default ladder, then only the default rank shows the next ranks tag.  If they are at the end of the default rank, then it will show the next rank on the prestiges ladder; if they do not have a rank there currently, then it will show the next prestige rank with the default rank showing the first rank on that ladder.


* **When the command handler starts up, it now logs the pluigin's root command and the command prefix which is used if there are duplicate commands found during bukkit command registration.**


* **Bug fix: Placeholders search was missing the assignment of the placeholderKey, which is what would like the search results on the raw placeholders, with the actual data that is tied back to the player.**
In otherwords, without the PlaceholderKey it was not possible to extract the player's data to be displayed within the command: /prison placeholders search.


* **Added constants for the default and prestiges ladder name so it does not have to be duplicated all over the place, which can lead to bugs with typos.**


* **Sellall bug fix: There wasn't a common point of refernce to check if sellall is enabled.  Many locations were directly checking config.yml, but the new setting has been moved to the modules.yml file. ** 
If config.yml has sellall enabled in there, it will be used as a secondary setting if the sellall setting in modules.yml is not defined or set to false.  Eventually the config.yml setting will be removed.


* **Found that bStats was erroring out with the servers hitting the rate limit so this makes a few adjustments to try to get prison to work with bstats.**
Basically plugins that load last will be unable to report their stats since every single plugin that is using bstats submits on it's own, and therefore it quickly reaches the limits.


* **BlockConverters: More changes to block converters.**
Added defaults for auto blocking, and for auto features with support for *all* blocks.


* **Bug fix: mines gui was not able to handle virtual mines with the internal placeholders.
This bug fix was included with the deployment of alpha.12 to spigotmc.org.



* **Pull Request from release.branch.v3.3.0-alpha.12 to Master - 2022-06-25**


This represents about six months of a lot of work with many bug fixes, performance improvements, and new features that have been introduced. The last two alphas were not pulled back to main, but they were released, This PR will preserve the released alpha as it has been published.

Also, this helps to ensure that this work will not be lost in the event the bleeding branch is lost/removed. Hopefully it won't be, but a lot of work has gone in to it and it will be impossible to recreate the current state of the alpha release.

This version, v3.3.0-alpha.12, has 300 commits and 323 changed files. The list of actual changes since v3.2.11 is substantial and the change log should be referenced.

Highlights of some of the changes include (a sparse list):

*    new block model - full support for CustomItems custom blocks - updated XSeries which mean prison supports Spigot 1.19.
*    major improvements to auto features - streamlined and new code - higher performance - many bugs eliminated - now supports drop canceling to make prison more compatible with other plugins
*    better multi-language support - supports UTF-8
*    Improved rankup - rankup commands are now ran in batch and will not lag the server if players spam it
*    rewrite of the async mine resets - next to impossible for mine resets to cause lag - Uses a new intelligence design that will throttle placing blocks as the server load increases, which makes it next to impossible for it to cause lag.
*    Enhanced debugging tools - if a server owner is having issues, prison has more useful tools and logging to better identify where the issues are - new areas are not able to log details when in debug mode - debug mode now has a "count down timer" where if debug mode is 8enabled like /prison debug 10 then it will only allow 10 debug messages to print, then it will turn off debug mode automatically. This is very useful on very heavy servers when a lot of players are active... it prevents massive flooding of the console.
*    Major rewrite of the placeholder code that identifies which placeholder raw text is tied to, so it can then retrieve and process the data. - Pre-cache that provides mapping to raw text, so once it is mapped, it can prevent the expensive costs of finding the correct placeholder - Added the beginning of tracking stats (through the pre-cache0 and will be adding an actual placeholder cache in the near future.
*    Mine Bombs - fixes and enhancements
*    Starting to create a new sellall module that will support multiple shops and custom blocks (not just XMaterial names)
*    Block Converters - Will allow full customization on all block specific things within auto features - will eliminate all hard coded block
*    Started to add NBT support. - Used in mine bombs - Starting to use in GUI's to simplify the complexity of hooking actions up with the menu items.
*    Added rank scores and top-n players - Rank score is a fair way to score players within a rank. It's currently the percentage of money they have to rank up (0 to 100 percent), but once they cross the 100% threshold, then 10% of the excess subtracts from their rank score. This prevents camping at levels.
*    There is more stuff, some major, a bunch of minor, and many bug fixes along the way.





* **v3.3.0-alpha.12 2022-06-25**



* **v3.3.0-alpha.11k 2022-06-20**
Plus luckperms doc update.


* **Mine resets: Fixed an issue when dealing with zero-block resets on a very small mine, such as a one block mine in that the 5 second delay was preventing from rapid resets.**
Bypass both 5 second cooldown on resets and blockmatching when 25 blocks or less for the mine size.
With running resets in async mode, with rapid resets for a one-block mine, the handling of the block breaks can occur out of order, which will trigger the block mismatch.


* **Fix issue: On the creation of a new mine, it would reset the mine a number of times.  This fixes the problem by only allowing one reset every 5 seconds at the soonest.**



* **Placeholder fix: The PAPI placeholder integrations should not be prefixing raw text with "prison_"; that is the task for PlaceholderIdentifier.**


* **minor items changed with the GUIs... no functional changes.**


* **Update a number of docs...**


* **Fixed an issue where if you try to use a % on a number it's causing String format errors.**
This now strips off % and $ if they are used.


* **Update Docs: LuckPerms groups and tracks... added images and fixes a few minor things too.**


* **Update some of the docs on setting up luckperms and tracks.**


* **v3.3.0-alpha.11j**


* **Since the chat event is handled within the spigot module, and since ranks and mines would just duplicate the processing since they both will hit the SpigotPlaceholder class, it made sense to handle the chat event directly within the spigot module.**


* **Updates to the prison placeholder handler.  This fixes a bug with chat messages return a null value.**
These changes also allows the pre-cache to track invalid placeholders now, so it can fast-fail them so it does not have to waste CPU time trying to look up which placeholder key they are tied to.


* **v3.3.0-alpha.11i**
Getting ready to release alpha.12.


* **Placeholder stats: A new feature that is tracking usage counts with placeholders.**
This is not a placeholder cache that caches the results, but it caches the placeholder that is associated with text placeholder.  The stats currently only tracks the total number of hits, and the average run time to calculate the placeholder. 
The pre-cache will reduce some overhead costs.  This also provides the framework to hooking up a formal placeholder cache.


* **Placeholders: changed the two top_player line placeholders that are the headings**
 since they originally had _nnn_ pattern that is getting messed up in some settings.  So removal of the nnn helped to getting it working.


* **GUI MInes: Update support for custom lore support within the gui configs.**


* **Update XSeries from v8.7.1 to v8.8.0 to better support the newest blocks.**


* **Updated item-nbt-api-plugin from v2.9.2 to v2.10.0.**


* **v3.3.0-alpha.11h 2022-06-14**


* **Prison Placeholders: General clean up of obsolete code.**
Since the new placeholder system is working well with the new class PlaceholderIdentifier, obsolete code that was commented out has been removed.
The obsolete class that used to be the key component to identifying placeholders was PlaceholderResults and is no longer used anywhere.  It's core components were moved to PlaceholderIdentifier and therefore all references to this obsolete class has been eliminated.
At this time, PlaceholderResults has not been deleted, but will be at some future time.


* **Prison Placeholders: Major rewrite the handling of placeholders.**
Prison's placeholder handling was completely rewritten to better handle the matching of a placeholder text with the actual placeholder objects.  Over the last few years, many new features were added to prison's placeholders, but the way they were implemented were through patching existing code. This rewrite starts from scratch on how placeholder are decoded. Placeholders are now only decoded once instead of being decoded when attempting to match each internal placeholder.  The results are significant performance improvements and eliminates a lot of redundant code. Some new features were add, such as supporting more than one placeholder attribute at a time.  Also it streamlines how parameters and data is passed from the outer most layers of prison to where the placeholders are calculated. 

Another major benefit of this rewrite, beside reduction of code complexity and performance improvements, is that it opens the door to being able to implement an internal placeholder cache.  Some plugins request placeholder data once per tick, or 20 times per second.  Multiply that by 50 online players, and you got prison performing the same calculation 1000 times per second. Caching could help reduce that to only one calculation per second (assuming a cache time to live value of 1 second. Caching will not always be so simple, or possible, or every placeholder.  Player-based placeholders can't be cached like static mine placeholders (mine names and mine tags as an example).


* **Add support for Portuguese.**


* **BlockConverters: fix issue when block converters are not active.**


**v3.3.0-alpha.11g - 2022-06-11**


* **Disable the gui for autofeatures configs.  They are so out of date, they were causing problems.**
Autofeatures should be manually edited.


* **Fix a problem when BlockConverters are disabled, and doing a reload on auto features, it's not able to find that config file so its throwing an exception.**


* **The build was failing intermittently on the continual integration (CI)**
pertaining to the item-nbt-api-plugin, so an entry to added to "lock it in" to the correct path within the mavenrepository.com repo.
This should prevent the resource from being paired with the wrong repo.


* **There is a situation when checking for new updates to the language files, that it needs to write the new file, but the old one has not been archived.**
This now checks to make sure the old one has been renamed, and if it hasn't, then it will rename it.


* **Added an entry for the sellall module in the modules.yml file.** 
Code has been setup to check, with a default fall-back on to the sellall settings within config.yml file.  The entry in config.yml has been commented out. 
Either will work, but the setting within modules.yml will take priority.


* **Update XSeries to v8.7.1 from v8.6.2.**
Note that this does not add any of the newer 1.19 blocks or items.


* **GUI: Fixed some issues with the gui and admin perms.  Added some admin perms to a few gui commands to lock them down.**
Found a serious issue with non-admins being able to edit rank costs and sellall item costs.  The GUIs were not locked down and if the players knew the commands, they could edit the costs.


* **v3.3.0-alpha.11f 2022-06-06**


* **BlockConverters: minor changes.**


* **Bug fix: Backpacks were not working properly with just ".save()" but had to add ".setChanged()" too, otherwise minepacks will not actually save the status of the backpacks.**


* **BlockConverters: rename targets to outputs.**


* **BlockConversions: hooked up the code to not only filter and return the blockConversions for the player and the block, but to also return the item stacks from the results.**
This is just about ready to be used in the code.


* **Romanian Locale language files were placed in the wrong location.**
Oreoezi provide two new language files for the Romanian Locale, but they were placed in the wrong location.
They were added to "prison-core/out/production/resources/lang/core/" and ".../mines/".  For them to actually
work correctly, without being deleted, need to be placed within the following path:
"prison-core/src/main/resources/lang/core/" and "prison-core/src/main/resources/lang/mines".
These should now be usable.  Also the LocaleManager now has alternatives setup to default to en_US; future
alternative languages can be added in the future.


* **BlockConverters: add some validators to the BlockConverters.**
Reports various issues, fixes non-lowercase source block names, and also disables invalid settings.


* **BlockConverters: Adjusting around how they are setup, and how they are generated.**
BlockConverters are now in their own config file: blockConvertersConfig.json.
They are no longer being stacked/placed in the autoFeaturesConfig.yml file, so all the conversion code is no longer required. With it being json, it now can reflect the java classes without any special considerations on the conversion process.


* **BlockConverters: More work on these settings.**
Setting up to work with AutoFeaturesConfig.yml, but having second thoughts about adding these configs to that file since it will complicate the config details.


* **Fixed a bug on the smelting of coal_ore which was yielding 10 times too much, but this was never seen since a silk touch pickaxe would have to been used.**


* **Placeholder fix for `prison_mines_blocks_mined_minename` since it was not being incremented after the fixing of the autopickup=false and handle normal drops = true.**
Also found that the calculated field for the mine's total blocks mined was not being recalculated after load the mines from their save files.  This now is working properly.


* **Major exploit fix: sellall was not indicating that the inventory was changed within the Minepacks backpacks,**
and therefore players were able to sellall of their inventory, logoff, and then when they log back on, it will be restored.
Now, all inventory changes are forcing a save for the backpacks.


* **Fixed an incorrect mapping to a message: auto features tool is worn out.**


* **v3.3.0-alpha.11e 2022-05-23**


* **Bug fix: Fixed an issue with sellall when the module sellall is not defined but sellall is enabled in the config.yml file.**


* **Bug fix: Minepacks has a new function in their API to force backpack changes to be saved.**
Before it could only be marked as changed, which was not enough to get it to save in all situations. Prison is now calling "save()" to ensure its behaving better now.
NOTE: releasing this fix with alpha.11d even though it has been added after being set to 11d.


* **Prison v3.3.0-alpha.11d 2022-05-22**


* **GUI messages: a few more updates and corrections**


* **GUI: More fixes to the gui messages... including moving all of the new gui specific messages out of prison-sellall module to the prison-core module so they will still be accessible if the prison-sellall module is disabled.**


* **GUI cleaned up by eliminating so many excessive uses of translating amp color codes to the native color codes.**
Found some locations where there were at least 7 layers of function calls, with each layer trying to translate the color codes, which of course was excessive.


* **Change the name of the SpigotSellallUtilMessages class to SpigotVariousGuiMessages due to the fact these messages are used in more than just sellall.**
It should be noted that eventually the non-sellall messages may have to be removed from the sellall module.


* **Spigot GUI Messages: Hook up more messages to prison's messaging system.**


* **Sellall messages: Start to setup the correct usage of the multi-language message handling through the new prison-sellall module.**
This fixes the messaging within the SellAllUtil class.


* **Move auto feature messages to the spigot message file so they can be customized.**
Removed the inventory full messages from the AutoFeaturesConifg.yml file.


* **The normalDrops processing was not hooked up to the newest way auto pickup is disabled, which was skipping normalDrops if auto pickup was disabled.**
The number of blocks in the normalDrops is now being passed back through the code so it can identify that it was successful and finalize the processing.


* **3.3.0-alpha.11c 2022-05-14**


* **GUI Menus enable NBT support.**
This is a major change.  The details for the menus options and commands are now stored in NBT data so they do not have to rely on the item name, lore, or other tricks.
This is a first phase, and more work needs to be done to remove hooks with the item names for other menu options.  Main set of changes has been done to the menu tools. 


* **Changed placeholder attributes to print the raw value and placeholder.**
Changes to the logging to allow & to be encoded to the unicode string of 
`U+0026` so it can bypass the color code conversions, then it is converted back
to an & before sending to bukkit.  This works far better than trying to 
use Java regEx quotes.


* **Fixed signs for sellall to enable them to work with any wood variant.**


* **3.3.0-alpha.11b 2022-05-02** 


* **Placeholder fix for formatted time segments to use the values setup in the language files within core.**
This allows the placeholders to use the proper notations for singular and plural units of times as configured for each language.


* **Placeholder fix for rankup_cost and rankup_cost_remaining on both the formating of the percents and the bar.**
The percents were being displayed as an integer, so with rounding, they were very misleading since they would show 100% when they were really hitting 99.5% and higher.  Also the bar is not working better, and if the percentage is less than 100%, then it will always show a RED segment at the end of the bar; it will ONLY show GREEN when it's 100% or higher.


* **Mine Bombs fix to allow color codes within the bomb's name.**
The color codes are removed for the sake of matching and selecting when giving to players so you don't have to use them in the commands.


* **Placeholder issues when not prefixed with "prison_" is being addressed by prefixing the identifier with "prison_" right away.**
This "is" addressed, but it's deep in the code and for some reason certain parts of the code is not making the connection to the correct placeholder without that prefix.  So this really is not the desired way to address this, but it eliminates the problem.  The reason why it's not the desired way, is because it's exposing buisness rules of how to handle the placeholders, outside of the placeholder core code.


* **Bug fix... with placeholder prison_rank__player_cost_remaining_rankname, and its variants,**
 eliminate the calculation of including the current rank since that has already been paid for.  Prior to this fix, it was only excluding prior ranks.


* **3.3.0-alpha.11a 2022-04-25**


* **Mine Bombs and NBT settings: this fixes mine bombs to work with NBT tags, which are being used to identify which items are actually mine bombs.**


* **Fixes the mine bomb usage of lore where the lore that is defined in the settings is no longer altered so it's now used verbatim.**
Also the check for mine bomb is removed from using the name, or first line of lore, and now tries to use NBT data.
But note, that the NBT data is not working correctly yet.


* **Fixed the usage of setting up the NBT library within the gradle config file.**
Fixed issue with unknown, or incompatible items were unable to be parsed by XMaterial which was resulting in failures. This fixes the problem by preventing the use of a partial created SpigotItemStack.


* **Hook up the NBT library to the SpigotItemStack class.**
This has not been tested yet to see how it works, especially between server resets.


* **Added NBT support to prison.  This loads a NBT library to be used only with the spigot sub-project.**
This has not been hooked up to anything yet.


* **Placeholder fix: Problem with the placeholder getting a prestige rank that was one too high.**
The following placeholders were fixed: prison_rrt, prison_rankup_rank_tag, prison_rrt_laddername, prison_rankup_rank_tag_laddername


* **Hooked up the BlockConvertersNode to the yaml file IO code so it will save and load changes to the auto features configs for anything with the BlockConverters data type.**
Removed unused functions.


* **Mine reset potential bug fix: Some rare conditions was causing problems, so using another collection to pass the blocks, and getting the size prior to calling the function to prevent the problems from happening.**
This appeared to be happening when a mine was being reset multiple times, at the same time.  The mine should never be resetting multiple times, at the same time.  May need to add more controls to prevent it from happening.


* **Bug Fix: The IGNORE block type was not marked as a block, therefore could not be used within a mine.**


* **New feature: Block Converters. Setup the initial core settings for block converters within the auto features.**
The core internal structure is in place and so is the ability to write the data to the file system. 
This has not been hooked up to anything yet.  


* **Setup placeholder formatted time values to use the language config file.**
This set of values will "NOT" reload when the command `/prison reload locales` is ran.  The server must be restarted to reload these values.


* **CustomItems getDrops() debug mode will list the results of the get drops.**
This will help track what's going on with the getDrops function since it's a complicated process.


* **Placeholders: prison_rankup_rank_tag (and the ladder variants) now shows the prestiges next rank when at the top rank in the default ladder.**
This only applies to the default ladder and only if the prestiges ladder is activated.


* **Pull out the setBlock and blockAt functions from the SpigotWorld class so that way it would properly track within Timings.**



** v3.3.0-alpha.10 2022-04-02**

** Release notes for the v3.3.0-alpha.10 release as posted to spigotmc.org and polymart.org:

v3.3.0-alpha.10

This alpha.10 release includes many significant performance improvements and bug fixes.  Although this is an alpha release, it is proving to be stable enough to use on a production server.  Please make backups and test prior to using.  This v3.3.0-alpha.10 release is "still" backwards compatible with v3.2.11 so you should be able to down-grade back to v3.2.11 without major issues. The breaking changes that will be in the final v3.3.0 release have not been applied yet to these alpha releases.

Please see our discord server for the full listing of all bug fixes and improvements, there have been more than 70 updates since the alpha.9 release.  The following is just a simple short list.

- Many bug fixes.  Some that even predates the v3.2.11 release.  

- Performance improvements: startup validations moved to an async thread. Slight delay between mine validations to allow other tasks to run (needed for less powerful servers). Improvements with sellall performance.

- Added more support for Custom Items (custom blocks)

- Added support for top-n players and added over 30 new placeholders.  Top-n support for blocks mined and tokens earned will be added shortly too.

- Upgraded internal libraries: bstats, XSeries, gradle, custom items, and a couple others.

- Many fixes: Mine bombs, sellall, autosell, auto features, block even listening and handling.


* **Ran in to an issue with spigot versions < 1.13 where a data value outside of the normal range prevents XMaterial from mapping to a bukkit block.**
This change provides a better fallback which ignores the data value, which is the varient.  The drawback of ignoring the varient type, which is outside the valid ranges anyway, is that it may not accurately reflect the intended block types.  But at least this will prevent errors and being unable to map to any blocks.


* **Change to prison startup details reporting to elminate duplication.**
Near the end of the prison startup process, prison would run the `/prison version` command to provide additional information in the logs.  This was duplicating some of the information that was already printed during the actual startup process. 
Changes were made to only add the information that was missing so the whole command does not need to re reran.  Overall this is a small impact, but a useful one.  It does shift where these functions live and ran from.


* **ChatDisplay: An internal change that controls if a chat display object (multi-lined content, such as command output) displays the title.**
This will be useful when integrating in to other commands and workflows, such as redesigning how the startup reporting is handled.


* **v3.3.0-alpha.9g 2022-03-29**


* **auto features: Enable player toggle on sellall for auto feature's autosell.**


* **sellall reload - fixed issue where the reload was not chaning any online valus or settings.**


* **Mine bombs cooldown - ran in to a null value in the cooldown timers. Handles this situation now. **


* **Sellall - added debug logging on the calculation of sell prices.**


* **Sellall bug fix on calculation boolean config values; it was not returning the correct value.**
This was found by a report that `/sellall hand` was not working.


* **Auto features bug fix: was paying the player, instead of just reporting the value when in debug mode.**


* **Update debug info in auto features to properly show it's within the BLOCKEVENTS priority processing.**


* **Topn calculations: handle a null being returned for the prestige ladder.**


* **Enabled a sellall feature to enable the old functionality where sellall ignores the Display Name or is not a valid prison block type.**


* **Fixed an NPE issue with checking to see if a block exists within a mine.**
This issue was impacting spigot versions less than 1.13.  The problem is with data values being abnormal and out of the standard range.


* **Fixed a NPE on the topn calculations.**


* **auto features autosell when inventory is full when using the priority BLOCKEVENTS.**


* **topn fix: If next rank is null, then try to use the next prestige rank for the cost.**


* **v3.3.0-alpha.9f 2022-03-25**


* **Placeholders top player: added new placeholders based upon the _nnn_ pattern to identify the player.**


* **Top-n players listing: added an alternative line.**


* **Placeholder Bar Attributes: Now supports a non-positional keyword "reverse" which will take any bar graph and reverse it.**


* **AutoFeatures debugging: Some color change in the logging details for failures so they are easier to see.**


* **Prepare for the handling of STATSPLAYERS placeholders, which will be the ones that provides the placeholders for the top-n players.**
This handles the workflow on handling the placeholders.


* **Slight update on how the top-n players are printed... simplifies and also cleans it up the formatting.**


* **Updated the rankup accuracy to be greater than or equal to 1.0.**
And conditionally only report the accuracy_out_of_range if >= 1.0.


* **When validating the success of a rankup transaction's abiliity for the rankup cost to be applied, the validation is now checking to see if it's within a plus/minus of 1.0 from the target final balance of the player.**
This covers the inability of floats and doubles not being able to accurately repesent base 10 numbers all of the time, which the accuracy may be off by a small value such as 0.000001, but that will prevent an equality check from passing.  
By checking that it's within a range of plus/minus one will help prevent false failures.


* **Fixed issue where ranking does not which rank is associated with each rank.**
Now the ranks will properly track the players at their ranks.


* **3.3.0-alpha.9e 2022-03-14**


* **Top-n: More work to enable.  Now supports /ranks topn, with alias /topn.**
The rank-score and penalty is not yet enabled.  Placeholders will be enabled after the command is fully functional.


* **Prison startup performance fix: On large servers with many players, the process of getting the player's balance from the economy plugin can cause significant delays if that plugin is not able to handle the load...**
so the validation of the players and the sorting of the top-n list is now ran in an async thread so it will not cause lag or delays on startup.


* **Prison version: including more information on ranks and add the ladder rank listing to the prison version command.**


* **Removed some old code from block event processing...**


* **Mine bombs getting a replacement blocks from the player's location.**


* **CustomItems drops: If custom items do not produce a drop, then default to dropping the block itself.**


* **Sellall: prevent selling with custom name items.**


* **PlayerCache earningsPerMinute: Sychronize to prevent an issue with concurrent mods.**


* **Mine bombs: Fix an issue with the generated mine bomb tool not being enchanted with the specified fortune, which also was effecting the durability and dig_speed too.**


* **Reworked how some of the registered event listeners are setup, which is needed for expanding to supporting other plugin's enchanments.**


* **Update the bstats configs for v3.0.0.**
Although it compiled without the bstats-base, it failed to run.  I suspect my local cache for gradle was incorrectly providing objects when it shouldn't have.


* **Upgrade bstats to v3.0.0, was at v2.2.1.**
Hoping this will better report the proper usage.
Added more custom details on the graphs: player count, defaultRankCount, prestigesRankCount, otherRankCounts.
Set api version to v3.3.


* **BugFix: Prevent a possible NPE when blocks are null when calculating gravity effected blocks, and ensuring there is a location when trying to place blocks.**
Both of these should never be an issue, but based upon different conditions, they can become an issue.


* **Added an autoFeatures to enable/disable the use of CustomItems' getDrops().**


* **CustomItems integration: Adding support for getDrops() from CUI.**
This integrates custom blocks in to getting the SpigotBlock (an internal prison block).
It's not yet functional due to issues within CUI, but this is the initial setup.


* **Report that bedrock users are not getting their tokens.**
When in debug mode, if their balance is not correctly updated it will report it in the console.


* **v3.3.0-alpha.9d 2022-03-10**


* **Within the SpigotBlock, now has hooks to load CustomItems blocks when trying to convert an org.bukkit.Block to a SpigotBlock.**


* **For unbreakable blocks, reinforce that the location, which is the key, will not be null.**
The block sometimes can be null, so by having the seperate location will not cause a failure if the block is null.


* **Fixed an issue when checking if a block is unbreakable... it should not have been null, so this is a temp fix to prevent an error.**


* **CustomItems custom blocks: Hook up the new drops for CustomItems plugin.**


* **Update some of the gradle settings and fix the new custom items api.**


* **Upgrade XSeries from v8.5.0.1 to v8.6.2.**


* **Update CustomItems API from v4.1.3 to v4.1.15.**
This update adds support for prison to get the drops from the CustomItem blocks.


* **Changed the development environment and updated the java 1.8 to the latest release.**


* **v3.3.0-alpha.9c 2022-03-06**


* **Enable the ability to split messages in to multiple lines by using the placeholder `{br}`.**


* **Small adjustments to the MineReset handing of the targetBlock collections.**
Prevent their instantiation in the constructor since they are being lazy loaded.  Also synchronizing on the adding of target block, since there was one report on an issue with that not being synchronized.


* **Added more validation checks and reporting on rankups and demotes.**
So if something goes wrong, it can hopefully identified and tracked.  
If rank change failed, or if a refund failed, it will now better report these conditions.


* **Setup a return of success, or failure, on custom currency functions.**
GemsEconomy does not indicate if it was successful, but added code to check to see if it was successfully manually/indirectly.


* **Sync set blocks fixes. Isolate the targetBlocks and add a null check to ensure thre are no problems.**


* **RankLadder: removed obsolete code that was never used.**


* **Some initial setup for a rankScore.**
This is not hooked up yet, but the the core basics are there and should work soon.


* **Bug fix:  Fixed an issue were a block would be added, or changed, and it would change all similar blocks in all mines to have the same percentage.**
This issue was intermittent and was caused by directly getting the block from the master list, without cloning it.  The correction to this issue was to use a search function that would clone the block, but it also would compensate for custom blocks if the block's namespace was not initially provided.


* **Bug fix: Risk of a null on the blockHit, so add checks to ensure it's not before trying to process.**


* **Bug fix: The clickable delete code is that is generated is off by 1 on the inserted row.**
The row number needed to be reduced by one since the row number was incremented right before this final injection.


* **v3.3.0-alpha.9b 2022-02-28**


* **Fixed the command '/ranks ladder command remove' when specifying a row value that was too large.**
The message was only providing one value when it should have had two, and the first parameter was '%d' instead of '%1'.


* **PlayerCache: Unloading Players... when a player is being unloaded, and they are not in the cache, the unloading process is now able to indicate that the player should not be loaded.**
Also when trying to load a player, it will not attempt the load if the file does not exist.


* **Sellall bug fix... was using the wrapper to map it to an XMaterial which was causing NPEs.**
Using the prison's compatibility functions to perform the mapping, which will now provide a safer mapping that will not cause NPEs.


* **Module prison-sellall cleaned up gradle config to remove a few configs that are not needed.**


* **Fixed a bug with the blockEvent block filter for adding blocks, it was using the blockEvents collection instead of the prison blocks collection.**


* **Fix placeholder for prison_player_tool_lore to provide the actual tool's lore.**
The placeholder was not hooked up.


* **Mine manager when enabling mines after the delayed loading from multiverse-core delayed loading...**
put a slight delay on each submission of the startup air counts for each mine... spacing them out by one tick so they are not all trying to run at the same time.


* **v3.3.0-alpha.9 2022-02-27**


* **Bug fix:  Sellall error:  Resolve an issue with the off-hand not being removed when selling.**
Turned out that you can read all inventory slots, which includes the off-and slot, but when removing ItemStacks, the remove(ItemStack) function then ignores the off-hand slot.  Has to directly remove from the off-hand slot.


* **Mine bombs: fixed issue with lore not being added.**
Was adding the wrong source; was adding the destination to the destination.


* **Mine Bombs:  Add some basic validations when loading the mine bombs from the config files**


* **Mine Bombs: add a reload function for mine bombs.**
/prison reload bombs  or  /prison utils bomb reload


* **Removed warnings from the Vault economy wrapper since NPCs can actually initiate commands and NPC will always return nulls for OfflinePlayers....** therefore just return a value of zero.


* **New command added to '/prison support runCmd' to allow an OP process, such as a NPC in Citizens, to run a command as a player.**
For example this is handy for having an NPC open the player's GUIs such as mines or ranks.


* **v3.3.0-alpha.8h 2022-02-26**


* **Bug fix: Synchronized some of the collections that are needing it within the PlayerCache.**


* **Bug fix: Fixed an inventory glitch that was preventing items from being added to the inventory.**
Basically the inventory had items, but it was not updating the contents of the inventory on the client side.  This was fixed by updating inventory when finished processing the adds.
If autosell on full inventory is enabled, and there are extra drops, then sell them all before they make it to the inventory.  This works most of the time, but sometimes the inventory still fills up.  This is now more of a characteristic than a bug.


* **3.3.0-alpha.8g 2022-02-25**


* **More adjustments to the block events so the config setting can be shown in the header of the /prison support listeners blockevent command.**


* **Setting up support for the BLOCKEVENTS on all block break event listeners.**
Changed around how the listeners are created to simplify and be more accurate in the event states.


* **Extracted the BlockBreakPriority enum to be an object on its own.**
Added BLOCKEVENT and added information on what the various priorities should do.  This is in preparation to refactoring how events are processed.


* **Prison tokens: externalize the messages related to the admin tokens commands.**


* **For the admin commands for tokens, added an option to be able to suppress the messages.**


* **v3.3.0-alpha.8f 2022-02-23**


* **The creation of a new sellall module which will eventually contain the code to manage multiple shops that will be based upon ranks.**


* **Adjustments to the configuration of the mutex to better ensure that only one job is submitted for the reset, and to ensure other tasks are not locked up, or locked out.**
There was a report that the prior way was causing the mines to lockup.


* **v3.3.0-alpha.8e 2022-02-20**


* **Mine reset mutex is conditionally enabled to ensure the locks remain balanced.**
To ensure the mutex is enabled ASAP, its engaged outside of the normal location... it may only be a few nano-seconds savings, but with OP pickaxes mining with many players within one mine, the mutex must be enabled rapidly.


* **Bug Fix: Mine reset changes: Eliminate paged resets, some code that is not being use anymore, disabled the RESET_ASYNC type to be similar to RESET_SYNC since they are now the same, locked out checkZeroBlockResets so mines cannot reset multiple times at the same time using the MineStateMutex.**
The major issue here was that mines were being reset in the middle of a reset action.  Used a preexisting MineStateMutex to secure the checkZeroBlockResets() function to prevent it from kicking off many resets.  These multiple resets were happening because many players were triggering the resets... as a side effect, there were many situations of collections failing due to concurrent modification exceptions.  


* **Getting the collection size was an issue by the time it was done processing the blocks, so getting them first may help prevent errors.**


* **Made many changes to the default configurations of the autoFeatures.**
This is to try to make it easier to use prison by using more of the settings that are most useful.
Added more comments to make it easier to understand these settings too.


* **Release v3.3.0-alpha.8d 2022-02-20**


- **Fixed issues with vault economy and withdrawing from a player's balance.**
It now also reports any errors that may be returned.


* **To prevent NPEs, isBlockAMatch has been changed to use the MineTargetPrisonBlock as a parameter and then internally, checking for nulls, it will extract the status data block.**
This was causing errors when processes were trying to access target blocks before they had a chance to initialize.


* **Address a rare condition where the mineTargetPrisonBlocks is being "accessed" before the system is done initializing the mine.**
This creates an empty collection, but it will prevent errors in the long run.


* **Add equals and hashCode to the MineTargetBlockKey so it can be better used in structures like HashMaps.**


* **Mine bombs: Added a {countdown} placeholder for use with the MineBomb's tagName field.** 
A few other adjustments such as adding more "color" to the default bomb tagNames.


* **Added validation check to make sure the player's balance was decreased, or increased, successfully before actually applying the rank change.**
If the balance does not reflect the change, then the rank change will be prevented.


* **Slight adjustment to addBalance so as to help reduce out of synch possibilities.**
The access to economy hooks, has been moved in to the sychronized block.


* **v3.3.0-alpha.8c 2022-02-16**


* **Fixed a start up issue with multiverse-core in that it now runs the air-count processes so the mines can have their targetBlocks defined.**
Many issues were resulting from failure to get the target blocks.  Not sure how it was working before, other than targetBlocks were not being used as much as they are now.


* **Fixed a potential error if targetBlocks are not loaded yet, or loaded at all for a given mine.**
Was causing NPEs.... 


* **Added logging for when a delayed world comes online and list all mines that are activated.**


* **v3.3.0-alpha.8b**


* **Clean up the way the command tasks were being called.**
Added mine name to the blockEvent logging.


* **Fixed a reversal of some calculations when converting nano seconds to milliseconds.**


* **New feature: debug count down timer.**
Able to now set a debug count down timer where debugging is turned off after logging that number of entries.


* **Potential bug fix in better managing if sellall should be enabled by directly checking the configuration parameter that enables it.**
Better logging of sellall when inventory is full.


* **Commit some SellAllUtil comments that are useful for debugging timing issues.**
These are now disabled, but can be manually reenabled when needed.


* **Some changes to Sellall to provide more flexibility and to fix some potential bugs**
The isEnabled now uses the proper boolean settings to indicate if the sellall utility is enabled or not.  Before it was trying to treat strings as boolean.


* **Add prison command descriptions that goes along with the placeholders.**
They are not yet hooked up, but they will provide more information to the admins on what the placeholders will provide, and also how they can use them since some of these will include examples of the formats.


* **Bug fix: The cancellation of the event was not being returned in the correct locations**, 
so it was bypassing all of the before mine reset commands. The before mine commands will now run correctly.


* **Prison commands: reorganize some of the structures used for the prison commands.**
Hook up some of the logging to track run times for each command.


* **Prison commands: reorganize some of the structures used for the prison commands.**
Hook up some of the logging to track run times for each command.


* **Prevent the autosell happening just because someone is op.**
To make this work, and to prevent odd behaviors where OPs suddenly are not able to mine correctly, OP can no longer use the autosell based upon perms.


* **Setup the time durations on reporting of mine resets to use external settings.**
Enables the use of singular and plural unit names. 


* **Rework how rankup commands are ran: in progress.**
This new way of dealing with rankup commands is to collect all commands that need to be ran, from all rankups, then run them in one group when the player is done being ranked up.
For most changes in rank, this will have zero effect on anything (mostly), but it has a huge impact with the **rankupmax** command.  
When hooked up (which is is not), this will take all commands and run them in a sync task.  So "every" command will run in a sync task. But each command will be monitored for run time, and if the runtime for one command exceeds a threshold, then the sync task will resubmit itself to run again after on tick.  This will slow down the process of running all of the commands, but it will help prevent them from causing lag.
With tracking run times on each command, if prison is in debug-mode, then it will generate console logs identify how long it take to run each command.  So if any given command is causing lag, then it would be possible to identify what the offending command is.


* **Fixed a problem before releasing... was not using the correct variable so the generated File object was not getting used.**


* **Bug fix: If a player cache file does not exist, it now prevents it from loading.**


* **Fixed an issue with the GUI, such that if the player does not have a rank on the ladder**, 
that it will now force the creation of a PlayerRank object so it does not cause a NPE.


* **Mine bombs: Enable the use of color codes on the armor stands when setting off the bombs...**


* **Mine bombs: Added durability and digspeed enchantments to the mine bomb data.**
This will allow for greater flexibility in how the tool in hand behaves.


* **If using a mine bomb, then do not allow durability calculations to be used**, 
since if the pseudo tool breaks, then what ever the player is holding will be removed, which is usually an item stack of mine bombs.


* **Mine Bombs: The mine bomb give command now is case insensitive.**


* **Mine Bombs: Add ability to set the Y offset.**
It defaults to a value of -1.  This allows fine tuning of bombs to better position them to sink deeper in the mine to increase the number of blocks that are included.


* **Fix issue with mine bombs not dropping blocks.**
The underlying block changed and therefore so did the behavior of the equals() function.


* **Added various token functions to the prison spigot API class.**


***3.3.0-alpha.8 2022-02-12**


* **Enable debug mode from within the config.yml file.**
It was not hooked up before.  This is useful for initial logging of the mine air-counts.


* **Redesigned the initial mine air-counts which not only identifies which blocks are within a mine upon startup, but it also establishes the number of air blocks in a mine to help ensure it's able to properly reset when the mine is empty.**


* **Bug fix: cleaned up the way PlayerCache files are managed.**
Eliminated a lot of old code and simplifed the logic to ensure the liklihood of preventing corruption of the player caches.  There has been some reports that the files were not being properly tracked and stats were being replaced with new entries. This also fixes some performance issues by caching the files in the directories.  So once loaded, the loaders no longer need to read the file listings, which could take a while with a lot of files.


* **Provide information on locale settings within the `/prison version` command.**
Falls back to the en_US properties file if the selected language file does not exist.
If the non en_US properties files are found to be missing a property, then the english property is used as a fallback.  These fallbacks are not written back to the save files.


* **v3.3.0-alpha.7 2022-02-09**
Set this back on an alpha release schedule.  The betas appear to have been pretty stable.


* **Disable the player's nms attempts to get their locale... spigot 1.17 and higher no longer can get that value.**
Just use the server's default value.


* **For the /prison support commands, the output is now sent to the player instead of just the console.**


* **Some minor changes to /prison debug to give it an alias of /prison support debug.**
Format a few of the messages to make it easier to understand.


* **Removed the backpack's object from the player's cache.**
 Backpacks are too massive for the player's cache and needs thier own cache system.


* **On the command /ranks set tag, added the note that if a tag is removed from a rank, then the rank name will be used instead.**
Fixed the placeholder for rank tags so if it is null, it no longer show a null, but now it show the rank's name.


* **Fixed the generation of the player mined block count placeholders.**
Was missing one _ after generating the specific block related placeholder.


* **Upgrade gradle from v7.3 to v7.3.1 to v7.3.2 to v7.3.3**
This is at the latest release.


* **Upgrade gradle from v7.2 to v7.3**
 - Changes to provide better security when runnign gradle to prevent injection attacks.


* **Upgrade gradle from v7.1 to v7.1.1 to v7.2.**


* **Upgrade gradle from v7.0.2 to v7.1.**
NOTE: There are a number of updates to apply for gradle.  Will commit on the minor versions and final version.


* **Added a few new placeholders and a new placeholder type of PLAYERBLOCKS.**
Added raws to the player_block_total per mine.  Added player_blocks_total and its raw counts, which is a PLAYERBLOCKS.


* **Added a few new placeholders and a new placeholder type of PLAYERBLOCKS.**
Added raws to the player_block_total per mine.  Added player_blocks_total and its raw counts, which is a PLAYERBLOCKS.


* **Changed around the logging of messages related to the use of autofeatures autosell.**
Added permissions to enable autosell on a per block.


* **Update CustomItems api from v3.7.17 to v4.1.3.**
This newer version of the API still does not have a getDrops() function.


* **Add more support for CustomItems plugin.**
It appears like this is working really well with auto pickup.  It should be noted that the CustomItems' API does not have a getDrops() so it's impossible to get the correctly configured drops for the block, so for now, it will only return the block itself and not any configured drops.
Sellall may need to be fixed and there could be some other areas that needs some fine tuning, but so far all is working well.


* **For CustomBlockIntegrations added getDrops().**
This has to be used instead of bukkit's getDrops() since that will return only the base item drops, which are the wrong items.
For CustomItems plugin, there currently isn't a getDrops() function in the CustomItems API so instead, the integration's getDrops() returns the block.


* **If cancelAllBlockEventBlockDrops is enabled when it's not valid on the server version, then it will print the error to console, then turn off this features**


* **CustomItems: Hook up on server startup the ability to check for custom blocks when scanning the mines to set the air counts and block counts.**


* **Clean up the formatting on `/mines block list` so it's easier to read and looks better.**


* **If fail on /mines reset, then needed a missing return so the mine reset success message won't follow the error message.**


* **Bug Fix: When mine reset time is disabled, set to -1, and then all mines are reset with '/mines reset `*all*` details' it would terminate the reset chain on that mine.**
This change allows the next mine to be reset by not trying to set this mine's next action... which is none because reset time is -1.


* **v3.3.0-beta.2 2022-02-03**


* **Added an error message when failed to add a prestige multiplier.**


* **New feature: cached adding of earnings for the default currency.**
This was causing a significant amount of lag/slow down when performing autosell, or spamming of sellall.  The lag was in the economy plugin not being able to accept additions of money fast enough.  
Now this simple cache, will wait 3 seconds before adding the player's earnings to the economy plugin.  When it does, it will do so in an async thread so as to not impact any performance in bukkit's main thread.  Also prison's getBalance() functions, which includes the use of all prison placeholders, will include the cached amount, which means the player's balances appear as if they are not being cached.
Still need to cache the custom currencies.


* **Update /ranks autoConfigure to set notifications to a radius of 25 blocks, and enabled skip resets at a limit of 90% with 24 skips.**
Also moved DARK_PRISMARINE down a few levels since it's not as valuable as the other blocks.


* **Bug fix: Correct the comparison of a prison ItemStack by using compareTo.**
The old code was using enums, so the check for equality of enums resulted in comparing pointers, which will never work.
Updated a few other parts of the code to use the compareTo function instead of the equals function since that may not work correctly all the time.


* **For command /mines set notification added *all* for mine name so all mines can be changed at the same time.**


* **Change notification alerts from runnign every 5 minutes to every hour.**
Got a few complaints within the last fewa days that the notifications are too frequent.


* **Modified SpigotPlayer to add getRankPlayer() and modified RankPlayer to add getRankLadder, with short cuts for default and prestige so you don't have to always refer to their names (reduce errors).**
This is to remove the "mess" from other functions that need to get these player objects, of which sometimes they are not going about it the correct way.


* **sellall multiplier add - Now reports if a multiplier cannot be added.  Also now adds the multiplier based upon the actual rank name**, 
of which it was what the user entered with the command, which may not match the actual rank name.


* **RankLadders - Added a boolean function to check if the ladder is the default ladder or prestiges ladder.**


* **sellall multiplier - Now able to list all multipliers.**
It lists them in a 5 column listing.


* **Add debug logging when calling the external events.**
Will have to revisit this when hooked up to multi-block events, otherwise it could overwhelm the logging.


* **Ladder rank cost multiplier has 100 percent limits removed.**
Value can be any positive or negative number now.


* **Update some documentation related to CMI Economy.**


* **Broadcast the prison welcome message to all online players when prison is loaded with no mines or ranks defined.**
The messag is loggd to console 8 sconds after prison loads.  The broadcast messags are sent 16 seconds after logging the welcome message.
The intention is to help bring awareness to new mods/admins that there is an easy way to get started with prison.


* **Broadcast the failed ranks loading to all online players.**
Its important that they know ranks failed to load.


* **Release v3.3.0-beta.1 !! Hooray!!** 2022-01-29 2:11 PM EST


* **Added nano-second timing autosell to confirm if there is a performance issue.**
My initial testings are showing that sellall has significant chance of performance problems in that selling items takes way too long.  Will address in the future.


* **Disable all ranks related commands within the GUI menus.**
GUI was bypassing safeguards that were in place when the ranks module failed to load.


* **Update the placeholderAPI docs to correct the formatting of the docs to match what they should be.**
Had to indent by two spaces.


* **Created updated documents for the placeholderAPI wiki.**
These are local copies of the content since the prior content was removed/vandelized.



* **New Feature:  Added support for Quests so that block breakage within mines can now be tracked and be applied towards quests.**


* **Bug fix: Lapis_ore appently does not drop lapis_laluzi when using the bukkit's getDrops() function, it instead drops blue_dye, then when it gets to the player's inventory, it is then converted to lapis_lazuli.**
Therefore, auto sell cannot sell lapis_ore drops unles blue_dye is within the shop.  I added blue_dye with the same value of lapis_lazuli to the sellall shop.  This allows it to be sold now through auto pickup and auto sell.



* **Bug Fix: Damage was being applied all the time.**
Found a field being initialized with a value of 1 when it should have been 0.


* **Prevent sellall from loading if ranks does not load.  Sellall uses too many rank functions to stand alone.**


* **Bug Fix: The new Ranks error message handler which intercepts all ranks messags was failing to load properly when prison startup was not set for a delayed startup,**
 which was because the ranks gui command (/ranks) was always being set even when ranks module failed to load.  Now /ranks gui loads only if ranks was successful in being started.


* **Initially setup to use the actionBar for the messages, but that is not working correctly with such high volume of messages.**
So disabled them for now, but will switch them over shortly...


* **Format the earnings amount properly, so it will have a consistant format.**
Once in a while, instead of showing a value like 165.00 it shows 165.000000000000001.  This is caused by the fact that doubles are binary, not base-10 so it canot always show the correct values.


* **Deprecated the MessagesConfig class since it is not implemented correctly.**
The messages should have been handled through Prison's multi-language tool, of which this does not use.


* **Try to use a different way to identify the item stack, especially if the bukkit item stack does not exist.**
This was a random error when using gravel, sand, and dirt on spigot/paper 1.12.2.


* **Clean up some of the refrences to the new/old block models.**


* **Added the new command: '/sellall list' that will list all blocks and their prices.**


* **Added comments that usage of auto features cancel drops will not work from spigot v1.8 through 1.12.x.**
Should work with v1.13.x and newer.


* **Fix some block issues, mostly getting the correct block bukkit block and limit it to only one location and function that ultimately provides these hooks.**
This release appears to be more functional, but it still should not be used since it's not fully tested.


* **First pass at removing the old block model.  Do not use this release!!** 
This compiles and runs on the server.  Most commands appear to work, including mine resets, but no visual confirmation has been performed in game yet.  Since so much has been changed and it has not yet been tested in-game, this release should not be used until such rudementary testing can be performed.





* **3.3.0-alpha.7 2022-01-22**

A return to the v3.3.0 release track.  The alpha.7 release represents a continuation of where we left off before.  Once we got to alpha.6, it became apparent that it was critical to release before v3.3.0 was ready, so we returned to the v3.2.x track, including everything up to and including the v3.3.0-alpha.6.










# 3.2.11 2022-01-22



# v3.2.10 2021-08-22



# v3.2.9 2021-07-03

- release v3.2.9


# v3.2.8.1 2021-06-18


* **Note: Bug fixes for 3.2.8.**

* **Fixed a failure on startup for new installations of prison.**
Basically it was unable to deploy the language files due to try-with-resources closing the initial zip connection.


# v3.2.8 2021-06-17

Prison V3.2.8 Release!
Prison now fully support Spigot 1.17 and Java 16!


**NOTE:** Since the start of the development on v3.3.0, Prison has had a few other releases under v3.2.7 and v3.2.8.  The reason for these releases is that the major structures (and code) that would make prison v3.4.x, are not complete.  Therefore, to get out new updates sooner than later, v3.2.7 and v3.2.8 have been release.


* **Released v3.2.8!**


* **v3.2.8-alpha.3 2021-06-16**


* **v3.2.8-alpha.2 2021-06-12**

* **Spigot 1.17 release - v3.2.8-alpha.1 - 2021-06-11**
Only known issues: 
   * Unable to use nms to get the player's preferred language

* **v3.2.8-alpha.1 2021-06-07**
Internally set the version, but will not release it until a few other things are finished.
The prison version is set to 3.2.8-alpha.1 to prepare for the release of prison that is compatible with Java 16 and Spigot 1.17.


NOTE: v3.2.8-alpha.1 is identical to v3.3.0-alpha.6.  V3.3.0 is far from being ready to be released.  So v3.2.8 will enable Java 16 and also Minecraft 1.17.


# v3.3.0-alpha.6 2021-06-07


* **v3.3.0-alpha.6 2021-06-07**
Setting the version.  The v3.3.0 release will be put on hold since focus will be to get v3.2.8 out which will support Java 16.  It is unknown how many of the spigot 1.17 blocks will be initially supported.

* **v3.3.0-alpha.5c - 2021-06-06**

* **v3.3.0-alpha.5 2021-06-01**

* **v3.3.0-alpha.4 2021-05-15**

Please note that the correct order of releases have been: 
v3.2.6, v3.3.0-alpha.1, v3.3.0-alpha.2, v3.2.7, v3.3.0-alpha.3


# v3.2.7 2021-05-02
