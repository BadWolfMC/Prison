# Prison Known Issues and To Do's for v3.3.x




# TODO Items for v3.3.0-alpha.13


- SimpleNumberFormat not always using the US location.  So UK uses NBSP (non-breaking spaces) for the thousands separator, but minecraft cannot display that unicode properly.  Minecraft shows a square box with NB on line one, and SP on line two.
Setup a global function within something like Prison, and have everything call that to get a SimpleNumberFormat object.  This way, there is only one line of code controlling it all.  Also can use the config setting to control it with the default being US.  So if someone really wants to change it to another country, then they can.


-mine bombs - access only works with mineAccessByRank? SailDrag
  - Expand to other access, like access by perms?
  - maybe have a mine bomb config that enables access checking so it can be disabled if they are not using prison's access controls.


- Add support for `{actionBar}` in the language support messages - riquour


- File save to new format - OmarG
  - pre-req for turning off TP
  - pre-req for custom mine shapes
  

- Ability to turn of TP on mine resets.  OmarG
  - Maybe have a special value for spawn to indicate it should TP?
  - Could still have a spawn point, but just not tp during resets.


- custom mine shapes - Chain and Fiba1 and OmarG
 - Have a new command to edit and save the mine's shapes
 - edit would spawn red/yellow wool - remove blocks - save would only save the wool blocks.
 

- fix gui ranks to remove italics from the rank names.  This may be the gui ranks and/or the gui prestiges.  - Bryton
  Cannot reproduce - No italics are being added by prison.


- DONE: Gui prestiges - option to remove the gui prestige button.  Not sure if any of the options in the config.sys really supports that.  - Bryton



- Prestige - needs improvements
    DONE: rewrote the prestige handling to exist in the ranks module. Everything is handled properly now. The GUI is passed the correct lore so no rankup logic is in the gui anymore. Prechecks are now enabled too.
  - DONE: Confirmation does not perform any prechecks to confirm if the player can even prestige
  - DONE: Confirmation does not reflect prestige settins. It always shows that rank and balance will be reset, even if that is disabled.
  - DONE: It's not clear how to confirm via chat


- when testing the block breakage with the SHIFT-click with the mine wand, I also saw that it processed the same block twice.  The first time looked as if the drop was being canceled, then the second time the event was being canceled.  Or vice-a-versa.  I don't remember setting it up both ways.



- bStats:
 - DONE: Remove Plugins & Prison Ladders
 - DONE: Add: modules, Economy (integrations), Perms (integrations), Placeholder (intg)
 - DONE: Add: Language
 - Eliminate zero counts (don't report)
 - validate that plugins listed in other reports are being removed from plugins a-z.



- `/ranks player` is not including all of the info for rank multipliers like it should have.
  - add them
  - List total rank multiplier. Show the multiplier per ladder.
  
  

- Custom mine shapes - Chain / darragh



- admin - prevent you breaking mine liners - me... on other people's servers. lol


- It looks like the following text field is no longer being used, but it should with the placeholders `prison_mines_timeleft_minename` ... looks like it's using the long version.  May want to provide a short and long format?  Long (the current default) may be way too long...
  `core_text__time_units_short=y,m,w,d,h,m,s`

- There is a potential error with the class tech.mcprison.prison.util.TextMessage in that all of the messages are using `.withReplacements( "%s" )` but yet none of the text components are using parameters.  So if a parameter is added to any of those, the `%s` could potentially cause errors!?  Need to test and if errors, then remove all of the `.withReplacements()` in that class.







- For v3.3.0 release:
  - BlockConverters
    - docs
  - Sellall - use prison blocks and not XMaterials - Move more code to the sellall module
  - Backpacks - create a new player cache for backpacks.  Copy the current player cache.
  - ranks and ladders
    - auto prestiges (unlimited) based upon formulas
    - new file formats - json ORM?
  - DONE using topn: archiving old players
  - DONE: more work on top-n rankings
  - /mines wguard - worldguard hints for mines (generate scripts to run?) - Use patterns that can be edited


* BlockConverters 



* placeholder bar debug is not showing anything useful.


- New custom block support: Based upon holding an item or a block. `/mines custom <block/item> <namespace> <hand> <value>`
  - Way to add custom blocks outside of the CustomItems plugin.  Capture NBT values too?  Not 100% what can easily be captured, or how to always id a custom block; has to be fast for block break handling.
  
  

- Transaction logs - Rankup and player joins would be good to take these messages out of the console.



- TEST: Add nbt support to gui menus.  Issue with rankup not getting the correct ladder name.
  - Partially added and is working.  Expand to other menu options, which will be time consuming.


- Print warnings if auto features configs prevent any drops. Include notice when drops don't occur due to autosell.
  - On server startup... not sure how to best check.


- auto pickup off, nothing was dropping.  LurgenAU



- autofeatures BLOCKEVENTS priority - include backpacks on auto sell - Ryankayz


- TopN for tokens - Phoung Nguyen


- (done ??) auto features autosell - tie to sellall's player toggle - Ryankayz

- SQL support - Six




- Mine Resets - Glass block not being removed - harold



- DONE?:  Archive old players - budderman18
  - archive all player files to a zip. Remove the originals. If player logs back on, then restore the archives. Prevent startup from adding these players back.
  - Archiving players in topN - this may address the archive needs.  Part of the issue was related to performance calculations upon startup, which the new topn does address.
  

- Placeholders - dynamic content - 
  - custom placeholders based upon other primary placeholders?


* Add a preformatted sellall multiplier
* {prison_player_sellall_mutiplier::nFormat:#,##0.0000}


- GUI forces admins to run auto configure.  Review and remove?


* messages - split on \n character to multiple lines
  - player messages
  - console messages
  

* Mine bombs:
  - glowing effect (enchantment)
    - give madog24 stone{Enchantments:[{}]}
    - ItemMeta.addFlags(ItemFlag.HIDE_ENCHANTMENTS)
  - throwing... as in egg or ender pearl
  throwableEnable: true,
  throwVectorVelocity: 1,
  thrownInstantExplode: true,



* HiPriority: calculated infinite prestiges - Fluffy_ak47

* HiPriority: sellall for custom items



- In mines block list, new feature to prevent drops for that item... which then can use blockEvents, but that would bypass auto pickup and autosell. 


- update LP docs with more info...
 -  https://discord.com/channels/332602419483770890/943874819101982790/943905937641574420



- %prison_rrt% (prison_rankup_rank_tag) Does not show the next prestige rank if you are not on the prestige ladder yet


- Prison GUI modifications to allow customizations
  - Notify Nick1 when changes are made
  
  


- custom block support: Items Adder - No one is using it currently.

- add `/mines set rank *all*`
- add `/mines set mineAccessByRank *all*`
- add `/mines set tpAccessByRank *all*`
- add `/mines set resetTime *all*`


- custom blocks not working with sellall.   Sellall is not honoring the custom block's names.

- Add ItemAddr for another custom block integration

- Smelt and blocking: rewrite to provide a list of conversions to eliminate current hard coding.

- Auto smelt is missing some blocks?  Symadude23

- placeholder attributes: Add overrides for "units".  kstance requested it for time, such as h,m,s...



- Need to get CustomItems working with sellall

- sellall get player multiplier needs to be rewritten - cached?  Currently goes through all perms

- automatic prestiges

- Docs:
  - finish luckperms doc
  - Placeholders details - Explain each placeholder

- Rankup commands: placeholders for {promote}{demote}

- Mine reset notifications logging to console - options? 



* Problems with blocks:
 - Sand or any other block that falls is no longer in original location so cannot break it. 
   - Might have to tag the blocks with NMS?
   - Just fixed an issue with a block that was in a mine with gravel, sand, and dirt.  MIght have been sand causing the error.  NOTE: prevent error, not fixed the actual problem.

 
- Problem with actionBar - messages are not going through.
 - sellall updates every second - different messages - but never show first one - PlayerMessages



 
 - block stats based upon drops instead of breakage?? (not sure if this has merit?)
 


-> Support for eco enchants:
  - Need to add an event listener and then have a new function in EnchantmentUtils handle the event, with passing continuing to call the normal rehandleBreaking.  Maybe name it rehandleBreakingEvent?
https://github.com/Auxilor/EcoEnchants/blob/master/eco-core/core-plugin/src/main/java/com/willfp/ecoenchants/enchantments/ecoenchants/normal/BlastMining.java
https://github.com/Auxilor/EcoEnchants/blob/master/eco-core/core-plugin/src/main/java/com/willfp/ecoenchants/enchantments/util/EnchantmentUtils.java



* calculate mine worth?


* ShiftAndRightClickSellAll is not working

-> DONE: Hook in to quests - Only on block break events so may not work as expected?

* Found a problem with mcMMO, Quest, and EZBlock support... only works on BlockBreakEvents.  I added logging to identify when they are called, but if an explosion has 20,000 blocks, then it will log 20,000 times!  ðŸ˜‚  So I need to figure out something before hooking it up to multi-block breaks.


* sellall - ladder based sellall rank multipliers 
  - so a ladder value of 0.05 would apply p1 = 1.05, p2 = 1.10, p3 = 1.15, etc...
  

* auto run autoConfigure upon startup.  Use autoStart as the base configuration for prison instead of nothing.
  


# Completed tasks



- DONE: prison commands if using ; for multi-commands, and if a space follows ; then it's not working.


- DONE: The command `/rankupmax` needs to be fixed - redonthehead
  - DONE: `/rankupmax`, or `/rankupmax default` is fine, but replaced getting the next rank with the new code so it works better.
  - DONE: `/rankupmax prestiges` is the same as `/prestige` and `/rankup prestiges`.  Change so it will go through the default ladder, then prestige, then repeat if enough money.
  
  
- NOT AN ISSUE: In the GUI menu, the config setting: Enchantment_effect_current_rank is off by 1.  If D rank it shows E being unlocked. - CITYJD
  - Looking at the code where this is used (player ranks and prestiges), the intention of this setting is to highlight the player's next rank.  So the settings name is wrong... It should be `Enchantment_effect_next_rank: true`
  - Locate docs that covers this topic and make a note explaing what this is for and why the settings name is wrong.
  
  

- DONE: Add `*all*` to `/mines set notification` - CITYJD
 - Fixed a few other commands too to provide applying the command to all mines.
 
 

- DONE: Force sellall before prestiges - kikiisyourfriend

- DONE: Auto-Forced-Rankups and prestiges when the player has enough money.  Kikiisyourfriend
 - a new autoFeatures entry
 
- DONE: Enable Access to prior mines - kikiisyourfriend
 - disable to prevent going back to prior rank mines.
 - See `prison-mines.access-to-prior-mines` in config.yml


- DONE: prison_rank__linked_mines_rankname prison_r_lm_rankname provide a placeholder for the mine's tags.  B0mer

 
- DONE: Mines tp: option to list all available mines per rank? Thaysa


- DONE: Option to skip applying the rank cost multiplier to a specific ladder.



. DONE: Use of placeholders in gui mines is not working correctly - PassBl
 - Trying to use: - '&7Test Cost P1:  &3%prison_rank__player_cost_formatted_p1%'
 - Using deluxe menus - may not be sending player info with placeholders?
 - Fixed: complex new calculations for `prison_rank__player_cost` calculations.
 

- DONE: Mine Bomb Name and tags not showing color - Thaysa
  - Works with 1.8.8
  - Fails with 1.18.2 - colors are fine in GUIs and commands
  

- DONE: Modified the `/mine blockEvent` commands to auto show the existing rows if only the mine name is entered for the command.  It will show the list of rows, then the user can select it, then continue entering the rest of the command.  There has been a lot of confusion on how to work with the blockEvent rows since it was not obvious they had to first "list" the blockEvents for that mine.


- DONE: If prison cannot hook in to the economy, prison should see if CMI is a plugin on the server, then it should try to enable the delayed startup for CMI.  Kind of a forced-auto-enable if CMI is detected.


- DONE: Mine bombs - If at rank d and in mine w and I set off a mine bomb, it will not break any blocks, but it will lock them and prevent others at that rank from breaking them. - redonthehead
 - player should not be able to "lock" blocks 
 - DONE: Player should not be able to drop a mine bomb in a mine they don't have access to
 
 
- DONE: command `/ranks topn` - does not appear to be sorting by prestiges first - redonthehead
 - Fixed? Force sort when using the command each time.
 - When player's rankup, should probably force a sort.  
 - The sorting should be somewhat low cost, since if players are in the same position, it short-circuits the sorting so there is less processing.  Ie.. if nothing is sorted, it's only one quick pass.  If only one player changes, then it's only moving that player.
 
 - DONE: Issue with topn Rank-Score.  When player is at top of default ladder and has not prestiged yet.
  - Rank-score looks like it's just their money balance?
  

- DONE: Sellall enablement - needs to be in module.yml, but must enable it in config.yml?
  - bug in alpha.12?


- DONE: A placeholder in PLAYER that will show the next tag for both default and prestige. - surawesome
  - but only show next prestige if on last rank in default.  Default will show first rank.
  - {prison_rankup_linked_rank_tag} <- [p]\\[d]  
  - {prison_rankup_linked_rank_tag_prestiges} {prison_rankup_linked_rank_tag_default}

- DONE: Top block and top tokens - Phoung Nguyen


- DONE: When placing a mine, it spams resets while it's setting up the liner and the primary mine.  May be an issue with zero block resets and having zero block counts remaining.  May want to initially set the block counts to something like 1, then after the mine is done being laid out, then reset it.  When it's in "tracer" mode, no blocks exist that can be broken, so a value of 1 cannot be decreased.i



- DONE: percent is not being filtered from `/mines blockevent percent` and is causing errors in the formatting of the number. Percent is also not showing the list of events to get the rows...


- Mine Bomb Issues
  - DONE: Not dropping blocks
  - DONE: give bombs only works with lower case... camel case not working
  - DONE: with a stack of 2 oof bombs, setting off one removes both.
     - The is happening when the bomb is so large that it breaks the durability on the pseudo tool, which then removes whatever is in the player's hand when it breaks the item.
  - DONE: color names for bombs do not work - xGeorge26
  - DONE: Control Y adjustment when setting the bomb.  Defaults to -1.
  - DONE: armorstand appears in animation when using color coded bomb name? - xGeorge26
  - DONE: Update to include more colorful names..
  - DONE: Provide a "count down" placeholder function within the armor stand bomb name??

- DONE: Need to externalize the time defaults... like Mine x will reset in x seconds from now.  1 seconds.  - ShockCharge

- DONE: Six - air count needs to be asynch'd since it is causing server not to respond for more than 10 seconds upon startup.  
  - Most mines are greater than 120,000 blocks.



- DONE reload is doing NPE when blockconverters are not setup and disabled.

- DONE mine gui - add custom lore to the configs
  - DONE: can now use either `{mineName}` or `{mineTag}` and title is now rankTag too. fix using the mine tag and not mine name
  
* FIXED: GUI Ladders - Perms are not checked so anyone can run these GUIs.  But other than viewing the ladders, they cannot run successfully the /rankup ladder command.


- FIXED: autosell not working.  McPingvin


- FIXED: Sellall signs not working when variant is other than oak.  BOmer

- DONE: placeholders are not using the time units as the mine notifications are using.  Therefore, they are continuing to use english units.  Need to fix the placeholders.  One is `prison_mines_timeleft_formatted_Mine`. kstance


- DONE: add support for NBTs - mine bombs - ClumbsyIsNotReal
  - having problems formatting mine bomb lore with current restrictions since it prevents bombs from working.
 

- DONE: placeholders - show next rank is skipping p1 when no p is assigned to player. xGeorge26


- DONE: Many errors when prison hits a standard potion. - jamo


- DONE: autofeatures BLOCKEVENT priority - check for full inventory and perform sellall - Ryankayz
  

- DONE: Rankup - Still not working correctly. 
 - DONE: takes money but does not rank them up?
 - DONE: rank changes does not alter the list of players at the ranks
 

- DONE: Top-n: hookup rank-score and penalty.
   - Placeholders - hookup placeholders to support top=n players.
- DONE: Top-n balance calculations using essentials - 2 mins 31 secs - Budderman18
  - DONE: move to async thread on startup - high priority
- Top-n - phuong Nguyen
- CustomItems drops - harold
- DONE: Sellall - custom blocks/items and items that have been renamed - harold & RomainD
- DONE: sellall - no sell renamed items - RomainD
- DONE: mine bombs - fortune not using the mine bomb's pick with fortune.. always zero - RomainD
  - debug is showing fortune 0
- DONE: CustomItems - not doing drops, even when drops are set - harold
- DONE: CustomItems - Not block counting custom blocks
- DONE: Upgrade bStats to v3.0.0
- auto features - normal drops may not be happening. May be using auto pickup code.



* DONE: The function isUnbreakable could return a null for the SpigotBlock/PrisonBlock. Change it so the primary check for that function is location, then block is optional.  This is failing because the bukkit block cannot be mapped to a XMaterial which should not be a factor.  XMaterial will be null for custom blocks.


- (done ??) Placeholder bar is reversed.  As the player earns more money, it shrinks instead of grows. - harold
 - prison_rankup_cost_bar_default
 
  
  
* Mine bombs:
  - DONE: prison reload bombs
  - DONE: validate mine bombs when initially loading... 
    - bomb name cannot have spaces or color formatting
    - initial validation added
 
* DONE: Works for me. HiPriority: Inventory full not producing any messages. 	alexaille


* DONE: HiPriority: NPCs are generating a lot of errors. Real_Ganster
 - Citizens running command `mines` as player
` Prison |  VaultEconomyWrapper.getBalance(): Error: Cannot get economy for player vote so returning a value of 0. Failed to get an bukkit offline player.`
 - https://pastebin.com/JusySWDs
 

* DONE: HiPriority: Add a event priority of BLOCKEVENTS which only does the block events and counts.

- DONE: **Fixed issues with vault economy and withdrawing from a player's balance.**
It now also reports any errors that may be returned.

  

- DONE: placeholder for player blocks mined.  artic1409 
  - maybe use **prison_player_total_blocks__blockname**
  
- DONE: update placeholderAPI with prison's updated placeholders

- DONE: prison support submit are only sending to console, not the user if they are in game

- DONE: When a mine reset time is disabled... it cancels/stops a /mines reset *all*


- DONE: when rank tag = none - was showing "null" for placeholder

- DONE: work on getting CustomItems working in mines again

- DONE: remove this warning message:  no longer used.
[18:58:51 INFO]: | Prison |  Cannot initialize NMS components - ClassNotFoundException - NMS is not functional - net.minecraft.server.v1_18_R1.EntityPlayer

- DONE: RankPlayer addBalance cache for default currency
- RankPlayer addBalance cache for custom currency - still needed!


  - DONE: You cannot afford the rankup is using a NBSP for the thousand separator. Using Prison v3.2.11, Java 16, and spigot 1.16.5. Cannot reproduce. Was a server hosting config issue, but not sure why it only impacted that one message.


 - DONE: SELLALL has huge performance issues!  It takes 2.3 ms to autosell, and full auto features block handling is 4.2 ms!!  Serious performance issue with sellall, and autosell is bypassing the command handler too!
  - added 'autosellTiming:' stats to auto features autosell to track actual sell time using nano-seconds... initial tests show there maybe significant performance issues.
  - autosell in auto features causing lag?  Flaco21
    - Issue with autosell causing lag?
  - DONE: see RankPlayer addBalance cache - 1250 times improvement! 


- DONE: admin gui - allows them to bypass No Economy safeguards.


* DONE: Add commands to list shop prices in console. Currently sellall is 100% gui so cannot be used offline. 
  

- DONE: lapis lazuli is not auto selling
 

- DONE: Upon startup the first time, broadcast to everyone that they should use /ranks autoConfigure.
  - Broadcast failed ranks too.

- DONE: update CMI delayed loading docs... they are "backwards"

 
 - DONE: No economy error message not showing
   - works on delayed startup
   - Fails when not delayed - gui ranks was registering on top of ranks warning
   
- DONE: /ranks autoConfigure - review setup and maybe enable skip resets and tweak some notification settings.




# TODO Items for v3.2.11-alpha.13



**Tasks needed for the v3.2.11 release:**
* Review some documentation and udpate... especially with the luckperms.
* Finalize the event listeners to use only one event (was three, now two, but reduce down to one).
* Review placeholders
* Try to hook up a top-n command - may be too complex and may need to be pushed over to the next release
* Review Mine Bombs and see if there are some simple updates
* Backpacks - may need to push over to next version
* GUI menus - Add the new GUI Tools to more of the GUI menus to simplify some of the commands?



* test Mine placements and resizing.  Something does not look correct with tracer and liners.



* create a command placeholder that will be able to add a delay between submitting commands.  Have it based upon ms.. and have it setup to be used when more than one command is combined with others.


* Command cooldowns - ranks - use config file to customize on a per command basis.  Modify the prison command handler to manage cooldows as a new attribte to the commands.


* Mine Bombs: identify bombs... new way.
See SelectionManager... Prison wand uses the whole items stack to identify a wand, instead of just one small part, such as name or lore. Well, actually, its only the display name and material... no lore.


* Add Mine Regions - Similar to mines in a way, where they will allow players to have access to the region, have mine effects (outside of a mine)... and mine effects would also be tied to these too.


* Placing mines could triggers many resets... also placing mines may not clear all blocks.


* DONE: command handler - Ignore commands in certain worlds


* DONE: Player Cache - Make sure the cache is loadable otherwise a new instance may be created that could wipe out the existing data.  
  - All player loads block... they do not submit a task anymore.
  - ~block for all loads - currently it may return a null and load via async~
  - (no) Track file last saved date and if they don't match, then create a backup of the file version and don't delete it.


* GUI Menu Tools
  - Page prior and page next
  - Current page
  - Go Back button
  - Background colored panes when no options
  - Current version is not tied to configs... future options...
  -- Hook up to more gui menus
  

* DONE: Add a base class for the mine bomb configs... 
 - DONE: Add a version so as to be able to auto refresh the formats 


* New documentation - Madog's knowledge
 - look for pins


* Add mine effects.  See conversation with Madog.
 - Use PlayerCache and existing utils.
 - Simple to implement some features, including flying in a mine.


**List for v3.2.11 release:**


* DONE: Players need to be restructured.  Move rank player object, or at least most of the core, to the core project so as to reduce the number of player types.  

* Cache player 
  - cache player's balance - Hmm... may need to put it in RankPlayer
  - cache player's ranks... only prestiges, default
  
* Top-n ranks
  - total blocks mined
  - total tokens earned (or currently has)
  - balance
  - highest rank: prestiges, default, balance
  - most online time, or most mining time (which will probably be better)
  

* DONE: FIXED: Issue with blocks.  Explosions are creating "untouchable" blocks that cannot be included in other explosions.
  - My observations were with multiple explosions leaving rings that are within the the radius of an explosion
  - I could break the blocks.
  - jamo said that the pillars that were created on his server could not be broke



* Review placeholders - add and test placeholders that are tied to playerCache stats

* Mine Bombs - Finish
    - Add sound and particle effects
    - Other features?
    - Make sure the bomb is set within a mine.  Do not allow it to be placed outside of a mine.
    - DONE: When exploding large bombs with block decay, there is a chance that you can get the first block in the decay as part of the drops.
        - DONE: Check to make sure the block broke is the one in the target block.  If not, then ignore.
        - make sure the block is not "locked" 


* Add a top 10 listing commands
    - Top player on server (rank / ladder)
    - Top player per mine?
    - Top Player per Blocks
    - Top Player per time
  
* Add Block & Time requirements for rankups
     - Upon rankup, player will get a new "object" that would track rankup progress
     - Would record current blocks and time for that rank, which is needed for when they 
       prestige.  The rankup Progress won't change until they rankup and it will be reset.
       It's used to subtract from current stats to get "progress".

* BackPacks & Vaults & Warehouses - rewrite
    - Add PlayerCache support with integrated backpack data object to track details
    - Create new gradle module for backpacks and other items.  Call it something like Accessories.
    - Remove hooks in the spigot module except for the code to read existing old backpacks to migrate contents.
    - Backpacks are able to have pickup and sell used against them.
    - Vaults are protected from pickup and sell - Have to manually move items in and out to main inventory in order to sell them.  Max size limit is a double chest.
    - Backpacks can be protected from pickup and sell via command, which can be used to charge players.
    - Warehouses are not normal player inventory/chests.  They are virtual containers for items and blocks.  
    - Warehouses have slots, where each slot is one item.  A slot can have a dynamic amount of items it can store.  The player can buy more slots in their warehouse and increase the capacity of each slot.
    - Warehouses - have formula to calculate costs of slots and capacity, where prices increase on both depending upon number of slots, and total capacity size of warehouse.
    - Warehouses - Initial capacity of 5 slots, each at 100 to 200 capacity.
    - Should vaults be tied to a physical location, such a server-wide "bank"?  If so, then players has to physically go there to access their vaults.  Same with warehouses.  A defined bank or warehouse would be similar to a mine in such it would be 3d and access would work anywhere in there.  Or a given mine could be designated as a bank or mine.  So like for example, mine c could be the bank so a player would have to rank up to C to access it.  Then a vault could be tied to a third tier prestige or something (but those don't have physical locations, but could make it mine a) or create a new mine that is empty, then link that new mine to that prestige rank so players have access to it.
    
    




* Mine reset messages: Have setting to control by percent remaining in the mine.


* Save files do not include the block type prefix. Such as used with CustomItems.
Not sure if it needs to?  Need to test and confirm if working correctly.  World coordinates would be wrong if missing.




- Not sure why the following would be needed:
* Auto Features Settings : Create an API object that has the auto features settings listed. Basically this would serve as a simple cache with a life span of about 10 seconds. So if a player is mining hundreds of blocks within 10 seconds, odds are these settings will not be changing... both server config settings, and the player's permissions. Can provide helper classes that will a simple check of all these details, such as passing tool in hand to check perms for auto pickup settings for the server, the player's perms and lore on the tool. ... as an example.
- Store in the player cache object, but make transient. Refresh every 10 to 15 seconds.. maybe even 30?
- Add to the auto features event so its available there
- Change function parameters to use the event and this new object as parameters... reduces number of parms...





* Multi-language - Unable to create a custom language file that is not within the prison jar.  It's been reported by Ingrosso that cannot create a new language file that does not match a file within the jar?


* BlockEvent processing queue - submit blockEvents to a job queue to run in another async thread... the individual commands would have to run in a sync thread.
  - This will release the block break thread faster and won't contribute to lag.
  



* DONE: https://github.com/PrisonTeam/Prison/issues/222
 DecimalFormat not being used correctly in saving mine data so if different Locale is used, other than EN US, then parsing the saved file can result in a failure.
 - MineBlockEvent is an example of where this was a problem
 - The offending sections were corrected and should now work
 
 
* Add option to /ranks to rename a rank.  Tag too?




# Start on mine bombs

 1. Select size of bomb. Configuration. 
   1a. DONE: Identify items to use as bombs
   1b. DONE: Bomb size
   1c. DONE: Bomb explosion pattern. Currently only sphere, but could include other shapes.
 2. DONE: Select list of blocks that will be effected by bomb explosion
 3. Throw bomb, or place bomb... start processing count down.
 4. Pre-fire effects: sound & particles (low priority)
 5. fire event
 6. Post-fire effects: sound & particles (low priority)
 7. Hook up prison's event handler for prison's explosion event




* DONE: Modified /ranks list to provide this feature
 - Maybe provide a /rankcost command?  Show current player rank costs with rank cost multipliers applied
 - /rankcost <player> <optional-ranks>
 - Optional ranks can be provided as parameters and it will adjust the calculations.
   - Example: /rankcost RoyalBlueRanger A p5
   * will show the rank costs based upon rank A and p5, no matter the players current ranks
 - Will allow players to better understand what rankup costs will be if they prestige twice or 10 times.



# **Mine Valuation Score** - **MVS** 
 - Calculate an estimated value for a mine based upon an inventory full.
 - **Total Blocks** = 2,304 = 9 x 4 x 64
 - For each block, it's percent chance will be multiplied by the **Total Blocks** to get the number used in valuation.
 - **BVS** = **Block Valuation Score** will be calculated by how many blocks are represented, times the block's value in /SELLALL
 - **MVS** = **Rank Cost** divided by sum of all **Block Valuation Scores**
 - Use block chances to determine amounts of each block. Ignore total stack sizes.
 - Calculate how many inventory fulls it will take to reach the next rankup cost.
 - This is a difficult calculation since it is based upon another rank's cost
 - This will give a score value on Mine Valuation.
 - MVS 1.0 or less indicates seriously easy and unbalanced.
 - MVS 20.0 would be normalish range
 - MVS 50.0 or higher would be considered extreme
 - Prestiges Valuations should be calculated on the highest rank of the default ladder.
 -Pickaxe enchantments, such as eff and fortune, will have a huge impact on how fast a player can rankup, but the Mine Valuation cannot take that in to consideration.
  

### others

* placeholder for total block counts and other playercache stats

* Include sellall costs in block lists




# **Possible bugs/issues:**

* Test BlockEvent perms... they appear like they don't work.

* If ranks module fails due to no economy, try to make that a little more obvious.

* If no ranks are defined and the placeholders are attempted to be used, it is causing some errors.  No economy plugin so Ranks did not load. {prison_rank_tag} was causing an error with /prison placeholder test.  "Server: Invalid json. Unterminated escape sequence..."
The ranks module did not load due to no economy.

* Sometimes Player Ranks lores placeholders from placeholderAPI aren't working, 
it's unknown why it's happening.

* Auto features - disable lore by default - Maybe provide finer grained control on lore features?



# **Document updates needed:**

1. Document how to use Ladder Rank Cost Multipliers

2. Document that to get TE explosions to work, you must also create WG regions in the mine.
  - may be able to bypass with creative use of Access by Ranks (have prison directly fire the BlockBreakEvents within TE's functions?)
  
3. BlockEvent docs need to be updated to reflect recent changes (select by number).

4. Review commands listed in TOC.  Remove obsolete commands (some ladder commands were removed).



* Top Lists - Command based
 - Top ranked players by server
 - Top ranked players by mine
 - Top ranked players by blocks?  



* Add a `*all*` for mine name on remove mines blockEvents.


- hybrid placeholder graphs - hybars
  - super impose text in the graph and have it still be colored correctly.
  - text can be centered, such as the percentage that is feeding the bar
  - For wider bars, the title could be left justified, and the percentage right justified
  


* mine groups
 - Have global sharing of BlockEvents
 - groups cannot be in more than one world
 - all mines must be a part of a group
 

* Eliminate the following message from logging an error, but just keep a note in the code:
 - Cannot initialize NMS components - ClassNotFoundException - NMS is not functional - net.minecraft.server.v1_17_R1.EntityPlayer
 - This does not appear to have much of an impact at this time.
 


* add all commands to the server.yml file.  spigot 1.17.1 is getting fussy.


* Conversion tool to import SuperiorPrison users:
  - rank is based upon perms `permission.mine.A` and they keep former rank perms.
  - No prestiges
  - able to reset ranks so conversion can be ran multiple times.
  - Unable to really do this due to offline players not having access to the perms.  As such, and also due to the need ceasing to exist, this has been put on the back burner.


* extended fortune : Apply fortune to all blocks that bukkit does not apply them to.
 - Maybe do this through a list instead of blindly applying fortune to all blocks with a qty of 1?  Some fortune calculations will result in a qty of one.

* hook up alternative processing to have prison force the running of another plugin if a setting is enabled. This way prison can "control" how it processes the "left-overs".


* prison command handler:
  - Add command cooldowns - time in ticks - And cooldownTypes: server, player


* Player Cache:
 * DONE: Money earned per minute with placeholders
 * Add placeholders for blocks counts
 * Add placeholders for time onlines
 * DONE: Add time mining: per mine
 * Tracking by items such as mines or ranks, where the player's status can be reset, presents some problems.  Such as the block counts need to be reset for those items, but yet, we need to store them for historical purposes too.  So if someone prestiges 10 times, then there will be 10 different times through mine/rank A.  If block counts become a requirement for rankups, which it will, then the block counts for that mine must be reset back to zero.  So there must be a "current" and "historical" tracking.
  - Online stats:
   - track which players are online... may need to get the active player list every minute?  freq could be configurable.
   - track location of player... if the player has not moved in over x-ticks, then mark them as afk.  distance traveled is an important aspect... so afk machines may keep them moving in a 1 block radius.  Might be able to see if a player is being pushed by water or pistons? 
 
 



* When adding block stats.... add player online stats.
  - add events that run, similar to blockEvents, but maybe call them statsEvents?
  - So after so many blocks are mined... or so many minutes a player is online, run a command
  


* Enable mine sweeper when auto features is disabled.  Not sure if this is still needed?




* Add support for BOSS BAR when holding pick axe.  Maybe setup placeholders in the config.yml?
- Example would be showing the bar and percent to next rank.


* Add mine notifications by Rank
 - I forget what this is.... 
 

* Prestiges: Rewrite and enhance so as to make it "automatic" without the need to create ranks
* Externalize the mines module on multi-lang
* Add top-n rankings for mines and maybe other ratings
* Add block break counts to players



* Issue with decay functions or at least it shows the problem exists.  Enable a decay such as obby or rainbow, then test to confirm it works.  Then enchant a tool (increase it's eff).  Then test again and it does not.  This was seen happening while OP'd.  May not be related to decays, but it appears as if enchanting causes the pick to bypass prison?
- Was able to reproduce this at a later time



* Add optional block counts to level up.  So if money and block counts are used, then both have to be satisfied.
If only one, then only one of those would be used.
- DONE: Count only the block mined and not the results of fortune.  It will be easier to control how much mining a player does by ruling out the results of fortune... after all, it's "Blocks Broken" and not "Blocks Received".


- Virtual Inventory Items from mining... With the player object, not only keep track of blocks mined, but have a virtual inventory to track what they have collected.
   - Hooked up to sellall
   - Have max limits and commands to increase and decrease the total inventory size... could have both "slots" and max stack size per slots.  So that way the players can buy, or rank up those components, just like normal backpacks?
   - Will prevent players from trading and cheating... 
   



* Add support for mineTinker
https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/minetinker-50-modifiers-tools-and-armor.58940/






* Plugin exception handling has problems
  - This is a very rare condition that it happens, but when it does, the global trapping of Prison errors produces a stack trace that is missing details.  Off hand it is not known where that code is.  Need to look in to it and fix it.
  


 

* Auto Features
 - DONE: Add a reload for them.
 - Enable alt fortune calculations as a fall through backup calculation if no fortune is provided for the given block  


* /ranks autoConfigure:
  * Show percent breakdown of blocks
  * Option to name all mines: list of mines.  Permit non A, B, C naming.
  * list world guard commands to protect the world (would then have functional world)
  



* Add a message count to the `/prison debug` features where it will only print a specific number of messages before turning off the logging for those targets.



* Support for Personal Mines:
  - World support - main mines & Personal mines


* World support: Only have prison active in the worlds specified?
  - World-main-mines:
  - World-personal-mines:
  
* Or have mine groups where you can specify one world for a given group.

  
* world specific exclusions:
 - Have a world list that will shutdown prison commands when issued in that world:
   - command handler should ignore those worlds
   - chat handler should ignore those worlds



  
* Ranks have been converted to have all messages moved to files:
* UTF-8 support.
 - If UTF-8 characters do not work, then they must be converted with a tool similar to this website:
 - http://www.pinyin.info/tools/converter/chars2uninumbers.html
 



* Fix per rank progress bars.  This includes adding a new placeholder series since you will have to include the rank name in the placeholder.  Current ladder placeholders are based upon the player's current rank only.  



* BlockEvents - Action based upon blocks broken, not a percent chance.
 - Based upon total count of blocks broken.  Example, after a player breaks 1,000 blocks, then fire a BlockEvent.
 



* global virtual mine:  To apply mine commands & blockEvents to all other mines.



* possible change to /prison version all to include errors during startup.  Errors would need to be captchured.



* To `/ranks autoFeatures` add warnings at the completion identifying that the user must create any needed groups.
 - Note that WG global region needs to have the flag `passthrough deny` set.




Personal mines.  Work in conjunction with a plot world?
- sellable and so would be the features with various upgrades
- Create a new module based upon Mines with new features to support player interactions and upgrades.




  
- /prison utils mining
  - Add XP direct and ORBs




Auto features not working outside of the mines.
- Will not support auto features outside of the mines directly.... too many issues.
- Maybe be enabled and working now?
- This caused issues and may have been disabled.



- Add new placeholders:
  - Top-n - Blocks mined for mines
  - Top-n - Most active mines (based upon blocks mined)
  - Update papi's wiki
  - Track stats on placeholders?  Could be useful in tracking down expensive stats.


- Top Listings
	- Ranks & Prestiges
	- Individual Ranks
	- Mine base
	- placeholders - dynamic - position in list
	- How to dynamically keep this in memory, without lag or delays? 
	  - Timer to track updates to player's balance so it's not always performing updates
	- Sort order:
	  - Ladder, Rank, percent, name
	  - Penalty for going over 100%?
	    - Encourage ranking up instead of sitting at one rank to dominate.
	    - if > 100% - Take excess and get % of rankup cost and divide by 10, then subtract.
	    - if rankup cost is 1 million and player has 2 M, then they will have a calculated rank score of 90.00.
	      - if cost is 1 M and they have 3 M then it will score them at 80.00
	      
	      
- Provide a generic placeholder that can have the value supplied through the placeholder.



- DONE: Add blocks mined for players



  
- Review the chat hander in the spigot module. It was rewritten a few weeks ago to fix some issues and to optimize how things are handled.  The issue is that the new code (way of handling things) needs to be extended to other areas.  So review the SpigotPlaceholders class and see how it can be updated.  Then end result will be less code and less potential issues.



- Optimize the handling of chat placeholder.  They will always be the same for the whole server, so cache the PlaceholderKeys that are used.
  - Partially done.  The chat handler was updated, but the change could be pushed in to other existing code to improve the flexibility and resolve some of the weaknesses that may exist.




   
Future Block Constraints:
 - GradientBottom - The block has a greater chance to spawn near the bottom of the mine. 
 - GradientTop - The block has a greater chance to spawn near the top of the mine.


   
   
Maybe: Have an alt block list for mines were blocks that are not actually 
     defined in that mine included there.  This is so air and other blocks that don't find hits can be included with the counts.  Needed for when blocks are changed so it does not lose change status?
     



  
  
- auto features
  - custom list of blocks for fortune



- Issue with /ranks demote and refunding player.
  If the current rank has a custom currency and the player is demoted with a refund,
  the refund is credited to the wrong currency
  - This will be easier to fix once currencies are fixed
 
 
 

* **Custom block issues**
- If CustomItems is loaded successfully but yet not using new block model, show error message
- Show a message at startup indicating that the new block model is enabled or not enabled



* **Prestige Options**
 - Auto Prestige - server setting or player setting?
 - prestigemax - keep applying prestiges until run out of funds
 - Eliminate prestige ranks - (optional)
   * Would need ladder commands
   * Need to define an upper limit of how many
   * tags may have a placeholder: `&7[&3P&a{p_level}&7]`
   * Have a base cost of prestige: example 100,000,000
   * Have a cost multiplier for ranks: example: 10% more expensive each rank with each prestige
   * Have a cost multiplier for prestiging: example: 20% more expensive each prestige
   * Have a cost multiplier for /sellall: Example: 0.005% (1/2 increase in sale price) or -0.015% (1.5% decrease in sale price to make it even more difficult per prestige)
   * Have a list of permissions and permission groups
   * The above settings are pretty general and would apply to all generated prestige levels, but to allow for customizations, then ladder ranks, perms and perm groups could be setup to accept a level parameter to be applied at a specific level.  Tags set at a given level could also be applied to higher levels until another tag takes it place.
   


- Prestiges max - if at max show 100% or Max, etc... Maybe set "max" on a placeholder attribute?


- Add a prestiges config option to auto add a zero rank entry for prestige ranks.

 



* **Combine a few commands & Other short Notes:**
 - DONE: Combine `/mines set rank` and `/mines set norank`
 - Combine `/mines set notificationPerm` with `/mines set notification`.  Add an option to enable perms.  Allow the perm to be changed? Maybe even use as a default the same permission that is used in `/ranks autoConfigure`.
 - Combine `/mines set zeroBlockResetDelay` with `/mines set resetThreshold`
 
 - Store the permission a mine uses so it can reused elsewhere (know what it is so it can be used). 
 - move `/mines playerinventory` to `/prison player showInventory` 
 - Add alias `/prison player info` on `/ranks player`
 - Add alias `/prison player list` on `/ranks players`




* **Value estimates for a mine**
We know what blocks are in the mine and the percentages.  If people equally mine all blocks (some only go for the more valuable ones if they can) then we can produce a formula that can tell you how many estimated inventory fulls it would take to reach the rankup cost.  That could be a really awesome "validation" tool to make sure one or two ranks are not messed up with either being too easy or too difficult. Will need hooks in to auto manager tools to calculate fortune and what results from block breaks. Could be complex.
`/mines value info` show breakdown of a mine's defined ores and what it would take to reach /rankup
`/mines value list` show a listing of all mines with the key details: value per inventory full, how many inventory fulls to rankup.








* **Update config.yml when changes are detected**
Preserving the current settings, replace the out of date config.yml file with the latest that is stored within the jar.  Updating the settings as it goes.






Enable zero block counts for parent mines.
if 100% block type of IGNORE, then after reset do an full mine air count so zero block reset works. :)




* **When creating a new mine, register that mine with the placeholders**
Might be easier to just reregister all mines?  Not sure if that will work?
Right now, if a mine is added, in order for it to show up in the placeholders, you would have to restart the server so all the placeholders are reregistered.
 * * maybe just automatically run reset when vital elements change? * *



* **Redesign the save files to eliminate the magic numbers***
Most of the save files within prison, for players, ranks, and ladders, are
using magic numbers which is highly prone to errors and is considered 
very dangerous.  Also prison would benefit from a redesign in file layout
to improve efficiencies in loading and saving, not to mention greatly reduce
the complexities within the actual prison code, which in turn will help 
eliminate possible bugs too and give tighter code.

# Features recently added for v3.2.11










* DONE: New update to combine block processing results in many block.getDrops() being combined.  Since they are combined, the extended fortune calculations may not work properly since it does not know how many original blocks were included.
- May need to have an intermediate object to better collect original blocks, drops, and targetBlocks.  It can include some of the more basics that are not tracked, such as original block count to better calculate the fortunes.



* DONE: Rewrite the `/prison utils titles` to use XSeries' title commands.  XSeries only supports 1.9+ so I still need to support 1.8.8 directly within prison.



* DONE: Common messaging framework so if hundreds of messages are sent, only one is displayed. Eliminate the duplicates.




* DONE: Revert a mine to a virtual mine.  Maybe with the command: `/mines set area *virtual*`.  Backup the mine's data file before updating and saving.


* DONE: the command /mines reset *all* is not working correctly.  Could be an issue with the chaining not submitting the next reset since this is all done through async processes right now.


* DONE: Add a few more options to auto features for auto sell, such on full inventory.  This was removed recently to stabilize some of the new code.
  - Just refined what was already there.
 



* DONE: Concurrent modification error on the MineTargetPrisonBlock when resetting the mine.  
  tech.mcprison.prison.spigot.game.SpigotWorld.setBlocksSynchronously() (146). 
  Serialize Id the mine resets and provide a locking mechanism that will prevent auto features from being processed when it goes in to a reset mode.  Also when in a reset mode, prevent another reset from being submitted so they cannot run concurrently or back to back.  Maybe attach a cooldown to the resets too, such as 10 seconds would be long enough to prevent a runaway chained reaction.
     - DONE: Create an object such as a MineStateToken that will hold the state of the mine reset (in progress, mineable, stable, usable, locked, etc... not sure proper terminology right now... or how many states), with a serial number that will be incremented on each reset.
     - (on hold) Do not perform a clear on the collection of MineTargetPrisonBlocks within the mine.  Just replace the collection with a new collection and let the garbage collection handle reclaiming all resources. Carefully review for possible memory leaks.  May be a good idea to hold on to that collection and submit a task that runs in about 30 seconds to perform a clear on the collection to release the resources.  This may be important since the target blocks contains references to the stats blocks and may not be GC'd automatically.  May want to null those refs first too.
     MineReset.clearMineTargetPrisonBlocks() (1799)

* DONE: PlayerCache Time per Mine stats - not recording correctly.

* DONE: new auto features autosell should place items in inventory that have no sell value. Items that cannot be auto sold.
      




# Features recently added for v3.2.10


# TODOs for v3.2.10 release:

1. DONE: Final testing of ladder rank multipliers
2. DONE: /ranks ladder moveRank not working
3. DONE: Forced global refresh of rank multipliers when a ladder multiplier is changed.
  - Should be simple
  - Run as async task
  - DONE: Force update when updating a ladder's multiplier - all players
  - DONE: Force update when changing ranks - only targeted player
4. DONE: Add ladder base cost multiplier to /ranks autoConfigure.  Start with a simple 10%.
  - Include message that it's enabled and how to change it or disable it:
  - /ranks ladder rankCostMultiplier prestiges 0
5. Add to /ranks player the detail information on rank cost multipliers
6. DONE: For '/ranks autoConfigure' add an alias to '/prison autoConfigure'

7. DONE: Change /ranks list so if non-op it does not show all the extra details.  A simplified list for plain players.

8. DONE: Liners: Some are only for later releases and do not work with 1.8.8.  So need to setup something to restrict the liners that are not functional for the older releases of spigot.

9. DONE: Hook up Prison's Explosion event. 


### Others

* DONE: Add a rank cost multiplier to ladders.  Sum all active ranks a player has to get the total multiplier to use for rank costs.
* DONE: Fix the "next rank" value with PlayerRanks.... needs to recalc with the new rank.
* DONE: When a ladder's rate cost multiplier is changed, need to recalculate all player's multipliers.  Setup a task?



* DONE: /ranks ladder moveRank did not work to move from one ladder to another

* DONE: When adding a new rank or mine, auto reload all placeholders so they pick up the new entry.





# Features recently added since v3.2.9



* DONE: Enable and disable confirmations for prestiges
 - DONE: Put in config.yml under the existing: prestiges. settings.
 - DONE: Move the GUI confirm to the same group of prestiges. settings.


 Player Cache possibilities?  
 * DONE: money earned per mine?
 

* DONE: Make ranks more expensive on each prestige....


* NOT-AN-ISSUE: If automanager is turned off, and /prison reload automanager is ran, it will reload the settings, but the event listeners are only registered upon server startup.  So if that condition happens... should display a warning indicating the server must be restarted.
- NOT-AN-ISSUE: Add a warning about event priority changes needing a server restart:
-- NOTE: these are no longer an issue since event listeners are reloaded when the auto features are reloaded.



* DONE **Get new block model working**
  *  Start to enable and test various functions
  *  Add in Custom Items Integration
     *  Code Integration for CI - Key to specific version due to api changes
     *  Pull in custom blocks from CI API
     *  Place blocks with CI api
     *  Not sure how block break would work with CI api?
     *  Setup sellall to work with CI api
     


DONE: - Block constraint error when there are no blocks spawned when applying min to add more...
  - if rangeHigh and rangeLow are zero, or the same, then need to set the high and low values.
  - May need to even set them when there are only a few?
  - maybe rangeHigh and rangeLow should be the actual limits, and not the high and low range of where those blocks actually spawned?  Right now it's actual spawned blocks, but if either, or both are 5000 blocks from the true limit, then the range of actual adjustments is artificially limited and narrowed.
  - Maybe add 2 new fields: rangeHighLimit and rangeLowLimit that is the actual boundaries? These could be used to help normal spawning? 


* DONE: On prison support submit mines, include /mines info a all?

* DONE: To all headers that are displayed in prison commands, show the prison's version to the far right.


* CANNOT REPRODUCDE: The command /mines delete does not appear to be working - User error?


* DONE: Add an *all* for mine names under blockEvent add:

 
* DONE: ladder commands



* DONE: On default ladder, at top rank, if prestige is enabled, then show a message that can be configured.


* DONE: Add hunger to auto features calculations


* DONE: /prison placeholders list - group by placeholder type.


* DONE: Placeholders for items in hand: name, 


* DONE: try out the new event priority code. if it works, apply it to all classes

 Player Cache possibilities:
 * DONE: blocks per mine?
 * DONE: time mining per mine?
 
 
* DONE: Issue with placeholders bars and rankup costs...


* DONE: prison should "scan" offline players upon startup and auto add anyone not already hooked up.  This will help reduce a lot of questions and make the first experience with prison smoother.... 


* DONE: Bug: placeholders are not working correctly when player is offline...
  - Example with the bar graph placeholders.


- blockEvent
  - DONE: simplify add - use common defaults - can change features with the other commands
  - DONE: Add a target block name
  - Not an issue: "Use of placeholders is failing %prison_ is failing on %p"  Turned out they were trying to use %player% instead of {player}.
  



Completed for v3.2.9:


* DONE: BlockEvents - add block filters - tested successfully

* DONE: decay:  Add a util function to respawn the block that was mined... use it with blockEvents.

* DONE: Ladder commands:

* DONE: Delete by line number:


* **Commands - Enhancement**
DONE: Be able to select rank and mine commands for edit and deletion, or even moving, with line numbers.


* **Rank Commands - Edit and delete**
DONE: Add line numbers and enable the ability to edit and delete by line number.


* **Ladder commands - global for all ranks in that ladder**
DONE: Add new placeholders for ladder commands to be able to have generic ladder commands that will apply and be ran for all ranks. May be able to eliminate the need for most rank commands.




**For v3.2.8 Release - - Preparing for Java 16**


   * DONE: Update Gradle to most recent release


   * On going: Review other dependencies and update them too, if possible.


   * DONE: Update development environment, and system to support Java 16


   * DONE: Update XSeries to support the new block types. Updated to v8.0.0 and then v8.1.0.
  
  
   * DONE: Enable the new block model - 73.5% are currently using v1.16.x so with the new 1.17 more people will be expecting the new blocks.
  
  
   * DONE: Auto Refresh for language files when version detects new update is available and if auto update is enabled for that language file.


   * DONE: In /prison version, if auto features are disabled, show NO details.


   * DONE: Confirm duplicates on BlockBreakEvents makes sense.  Fixed the BlockBreakEvents by making sure they all had their own classes so they could be identified as to what they really are.  This cleaned up a lot, and also eliminated one set of duplicates too.


   * Works: This was not an issue. Ranks info raw tag is not showing the editing formats...  The rank I saw this on did not have any formatting.


   * DONE: Fortune on all blocks is not working...

  
   * DONE: Hook up java version on /prison version's plugin listings

  
   * DONE: Issue with nms with SpigotPlayer... does not work with 1.17.  
     - Disabled when fails.  No longer produces stack traces.


**Other additions and changes:**


* **Prestige Options**
 - DONE: Reset money on prestige - boolean option
 - DONE: Prevent reset of default ladder on prestiging.
 - DONE: rankmax - keep applying rankups until run out of funds


- DONE: Update /prison autofeatures to include new settings.


- DONE: Could make /prison autofeatures reload happen. Alias: /prison reload autofeatures


- DONE * Mines TP warmup



- DONE: * Issue with removing a BlockEvent by clicking on the remove link.  It converts all of the & to the raw code.
 - `/mines blockEvent remove` now uses line numbers so this is no longer an issue.
 
 
- DONE - Used load delays - Rare condition caused by FAWEs where prison loads before CMI even though it all configured to do so otherwise.  
  - May be able to provide a way to force the ranks module loading so that way it can just "assume" everything is working.
  - Force the loading of Ranks module if there is a failure.  Found that FAWEs is screwing up the loading sequence of prison when dealing with CMI, and as such, ranks are failing to load since CMI loads after prison.  Setting softdepend for all of these do not help.


DONE * Add `/prison debug` targets so specific kinds of debug messages can be turned on and off so it does not flood the console with tons of irrelevant messages.


DONE * replace ranks with mine related commands with ranks.  
  - can eliminate permissions on /mtp and mine accessperms.


DONE * Add system stats to `/prison version`




DONE: If starting up prison and there are 0 ranks and 0 mines, then submit a delayed job that will run in 10 seconds to print out a message to console on how to run `/ranks autoConfigure` for quick setup... include link to the online docs.


DONE: rank commands - remove by line number
  - DONE: Same for mine commands
 




* **Works fine: Bug in /ranks autoConfigure??:  Confirmed everything is OK... No bugs** 
An admin must have messed up mine A since blocks were gone and other settings were not correct. They could have ran `/ranks autoConfigure force` after creating mine a manually.



* **Rework rank permissions to eliminate need to put perms in rank commands**
  - **NOTE: This was a fail!!**
    - This did not work because:
      1. You cannot access group perms through bukkit
      2. You cannot create new group perms through vault
      3. It's not possible to easily check perms through vault
    - This has been made obsolete with the use of Access by Rank !!
- Enhance the PermissionIntegration abstract class to also work with group perms.
- Add to ranks two new fields: permissions and permissionGroups.  Save and load.
- Add a new boolean field to ranks: usePermissions. Save and load.
- Add support for these perms within rank commands
- Rewrite rankups to use these perms when ranking up, promote, demote, and also for prestiges

* **NOTICE - About Prison, Java 16, and Minecraft 1.17**

Prison is all about providing the best experience for your server environment.In order to look toward the future, so we can continue to provide the best possible experience, we have to set limits on what we can actually provide support on.  We are currently entering a challenging period of time where we will have to make some difficult decisions to help ensure the best possible future for Prison.

Minecraft 1.17 is scheduled to be released on June 8th, 2021. The release of 1.17 brings with it some major changes that will have significant ripples throughout the minecraft server community, mostly due to the heavy dependency upon Java 1.8 for many years.  This ultimately means there are a lot of unknowns that we will have to work through and there will be situations that were unexpected.

One major change in our support statement is that Prison, as of right now, will only *officially* support Spigot v1.8.8 (10.9% usage), v1.12 (10.9% usage), and v1.16.5 (73.5% usage). These three versions of Spigot represents 95.3% of all servers using the Prison plugin.  This does not include any server that has disabled the bstats, which is one reason why you should keep that enabled so you can be represented in our stats and our plans for the future. 

Note: The follow up versions in descending order of usage are: v1.14.4 (1.6% usage), v1.13.2 (1.2% usage), v1.15.2 (1.2% usage), and v1.11.2 (0.9% usage).  No other versions are recorded by bStats.

But please keep in mind, as with our official stance of only supporting Spigot, we will also *provide* as-needed support for Paper and other Spigot compatible platforms. We want you to have the flexibility to use the platform that best suites your needs.  We just will not pre-test on those platforms, but we will try to address any issues that are brought to our attention. The non-supported versions of Spigot falls under this same limitation of support: we will not pre-test for the non-supported versions, but if you are using them and find issues, we will work with you to resolve them. The actual impact of dropping support for 1.9, 1.10, 1.11, 1.13, 1.14, and 1.15 should have no impact on quality for those releases of Spigot, but it will free up a lot of time spent on testing.


Some initial testing with running a prison server using Java 16:
* Spigot v1.8.8 will startup and run. But there are major failures with missing classes that are critical for the core bukkit and Java components to work properly.  It is doubtful a fix will ever be provided.
* It has been noted that bukkit/spigot 1.8 through 1.11 will not work with Java 11 and later.
* Spigot v1.12.2 compiled with Java 1.8 appears to work perfectly well with Java 16 running on the server.
* Spigot v1.16.5 compiled with Java 1.8 appears to work perfectly well with Java 16 running on the server.


I have not tried to compile anything with Java 16 since I need to first update the Prison build environment to support it.  But these are tests that will be explored in the very near future so as to get a better understanding on what we can expect from the build process.


In the last few days, I've updated gradle to the latest release so it will support Java 16.  Other resources have been updated too.  More work will be done over the next week or two to prepare for MC 1.17 and Java 16.


NOTE: At this time, I think there will have to be two builds.  One with Java 1.8 for Spigot versions 1.8 through 1.16.5.  Then another build with Java 16 that will support Spigot 1.12 through 17.  This will give admins the flexibility to choose the version of Java to run on their servers that they are most comfortable with.  Initially, these builds will be automated, but initially they may be a manual process.



**Prison v3.2.8 will be targeted to support Java 16, and hopefully, Minecraft v1.17 too.**



Java 1.8 and Java 11 have a built-in javascript engine. Java 16 does not.
This plugin provides support, and compatibility, with javascript processing.
Other plugins that use javascript, such as papi, would have to be compiled
to work with this plugin.
